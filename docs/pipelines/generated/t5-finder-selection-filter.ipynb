Mostly, that means water turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would  also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.  As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe condition. If any random private citizen could not properly keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation is clearly appropriate.    I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community. If you look at the American  revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for  example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate. But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited for that.  There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example) a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively) should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a  disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower. The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only 50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite different from the general public (at the very least, they would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\",\"Well, it seems the \\\"National Sales Tax\\\" has gotten its very       own CNN news LOGO!

I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.  Jon  ---------------- sig file broken....  please try later...\",\" Umm, perhaps you could explain what 'rights' we are talking about here ..\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\" Ok, I'll bite.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.        Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said \\\"burp\\\", for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \\\"taking the Lord's  name in vain\\\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God's code could include, \\\"Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on\\\", but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \\\"morality\\\" can be sensibly applied.\",\"    I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.

I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.

In that post you stated that the \\\"wrap\\\" was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and \\\"wrap\\\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.

Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University. It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.  In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.  They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.     The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and  X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.  The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.  Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!\",\" The \\\"so sacred it's secret\\\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\"Kirsch Pull down Window Shades   - White, Light Filtering  - 73.25\\\" Wide, 72\\\" High, can be cut to width  - Brand new, unopened  - \\\"Best Quality\\\", Vinyl Coated Cotton  - Mounting Brackets included  - $35 (Bought at $60 at J.C.Penney)\",\" You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any  of the Quadra or Centris machines.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith.

The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed.

The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors.

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \",\"Just my luck.

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\" These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had expressly set apart from the rest of the world.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E.

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

If you want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However,  the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the \\\"truth\\\" and to discern  the bias.   Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't  change.\",\" Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.  Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically, the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem. Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's, of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:  Completely out - never again - items:  o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)  o popcorn (same)  o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins  o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)  Discouraged greatly:  o raw vegetables (too fibrous)  o wheat and raw grain breads  o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)  o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)  o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)  o long grain and wild rice (husky)  o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)  o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing  I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again! Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.  As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But this is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for discussion.  Good luck!  -Spenser  \",\"[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say \\\"God just exists\\\" and can't say \\\"The universe just  exists\\\" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural  laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"To following up my own note: : : : : It looks like everything works as advertised but I am disappointed : : with the speed.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.\",\"I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here  also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend  extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33  MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the  3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate  appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of  spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is  certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA  local bus.

God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour of Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4.  WASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6.  I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with WASH.

It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place. However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that, I will say PITT in 6.  BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6. MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great. The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the B's.  B's in 6.   CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7. Yikes.

Earlier, you said that it must be a conscious act.  By your definition, no instinctive behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  You are trying to apply human terms to non-humans.  I think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.   I try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.  And, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  However, it seems silly to talk of a \\\"moral\\\" planet because it obeys the laws of phyics.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"                                              ^^^^  ^^^^^^^^                                              ^^^  Geez, can I type or what?  --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\",\"                 steps deleted {> ... {>  {> It's an interesting idea, but the worst-case data patterns developed to {> test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect {> common faults in memory chips. {>  I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago. getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.

We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite.

From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.    EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer    SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the  Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a  nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than  950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as  12,000 people.    Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco  authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how  operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and  infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,  right-wing and what they called \\\"pinko\\\" organizations.    Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known  organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting  anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking  any laws.    Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to  gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los  Angeles and San Francisco.    Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political  spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan  Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish  Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of  directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San  Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.    People who were subjects of the spy operation included former  Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.  LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who  is based in South Africa.    Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was  confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement  agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and  organizations was sold separately to the South African government.    In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from  police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony  counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West  Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify  the search warrant.    The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than  25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.  Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in  San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax  attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not  be reached for comment, his office said.    Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a  panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial  recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a  former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.    The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied  repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.  League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an  employee and have said they simply traded information with police  departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.    But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,  San Francisco police alleged that \\\"ADL employees were apparently less  than truthful\\\" in providing information during an earlier search  conducted without a warrant.    David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said  the organization has not violated the law.  \\\"There is nothing  nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\\\" he said.  \\\"Our  record speaks for itself.\\\"    The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret  fund used to pay for \\\"fact-finding operations.\\\"  Lehrer, according to  the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.  Patterson.    An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to  a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending  them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.    Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for  nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with  San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many  sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as  \\\"Skins\\\" and \\\"Pinkos,\\\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were  under surveillance.    \\\"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\\\" Bullock said.  \\\"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a  threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,  say, 'Pinko.'\\\"    In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police  Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he  was questioned by the FBI in the case.    A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records  and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,  vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license  photographs.    Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and  Bullock also provided information to the South African government,  receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.    The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the  South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss  nature of the spy operation.    The file notes that Kraft's articles \\\"appear frequently in The Times  and are well researched and written,\\\" but little else about the file  is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another  Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong  Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal  information.    Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how  Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from  skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash  of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his  own paid informants under code names such as \\\"Scott\\\" and \\\"Scumbag.\\\"    He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,  exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,  including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.    It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying  on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African  government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an  agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the  probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The  Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather  information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,  Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and  investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league  offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of  San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax  Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to  cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los  Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that  some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may  have come from Los Angeles police officers.        From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.    ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION    By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.    SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a  civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities  who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential  police information on citizens and groups.    But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation  League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many  felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax  violations and conspiracy.    Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful  about its spying operations, which collected information on more than  12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political  spectrum.    Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show  that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept  files on political figures.    Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down  its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when  deciding what charges to file.    In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.  Foxman described the ADL as \\\"a Jewish defense agency which has fought  to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80  years.\\\"    Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on  extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing  information to police, journalists, academics, government officials  and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain  information illegally, he said.    \\\"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and  physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or  identity of any source of information,\\\" Foxman said.    The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its  longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \\\"a private  individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\\\"    Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements  showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through  Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.    \\\"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be  distanced from ADL,\\\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.  Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.    Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate  with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn  over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's  offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.    A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,  produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial  transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it  will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.    \\\"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\\\"  the district attorney said.\",\"What can be done, short of circumcision, for an adult male whose foreskin will not retract?  \",\" While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms fire can not be made for field pieces.   As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically \\\"Lebanon for the Lebanese\\\" motivated.  I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does come to mind however,   Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and that their stated position is:  1.  No peace talks.  2.  No peace talks.  .  .  .  .  N-1. No peace talks.  N.  No Israel  if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?   Bearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable than civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow to act in that manner.   I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria. I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion would lead to a second pullout.   <*sigh*>  Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people? \",\"       Hmm ...

Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.

Each one is made to order, at least if you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', I believe).    See below    I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It is made of 3/4\\\" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable. It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately, professionals can open it rather easily:   1) Freeze a link.   2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).   3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are   frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.   For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is anywhere from 1/2\\\" to 7/8\\\" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8\\\" model).   All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel. Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.   FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.

Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?   Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken\",\"To everyone who wants fonts in Vivid/POV/Polyray. The Borland BGI font converter is VVFONT18.ZIP.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"Actually, the \\\"ether\\\" stuff sounded a fair bit like a bizzare, qualitative corruption of general relativity.  nothing to do with the old-fashioned, ether, though.  maybe somebody could loan him a GR text at a low level.  didn't get much further than that, tho.... whew. \",\": As far as I can tell, the MD is an offshoot of technology that already exists. : It is an MO drive.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...  The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually \\\"logical\\\" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \\\"inbetween\\\" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the \\\"logical\\\" disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to \\\"reserve\\\" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.

I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\" OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I ask this again:  1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be    I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?  2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies    hole currents over normal electron currents?  3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of    hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual    test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,    don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,    resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,    magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).  NOTES:     to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area    where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole    particles only exist in the presence of matter.    Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain    semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).    I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such    currents *if* they exist.

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\" I generally find that after two or three decent hits of nitrous, my riding improves enormously.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.  So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.\",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----  Hi all..  Does anyone know of a UNIX utility allowing encrypted telnet sessions using public-key?

Please post. \",\"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"THE DIVINE MASTERS                              Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that            Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God            into the physical world, God Incarnate.                            But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \\\"SOUL TRAVEL\\\")            REPLACE blind faith.

Joseph Biden, D-Del., told  Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-  Herzegovina.   Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for  what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of   ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of  civilians.   ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact  that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones  and we ought to pick a couple.''   Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the  former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have  a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.   Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to                      ****************************************************  the radical Islamic government of Iran. *************************************** O, I C!

While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in the 1989 US-Canada FTA, there's probably a law about that (having health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here, for example).

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \\\"external\\\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \\\"beacon\\\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \\\"target\\\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn\",\"->  -> Some recent postings remind me that I had read about risks  -> associated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens  -> are generated.

If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful* You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt. Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.    I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom is that when you move the mouse, it seems to \\\"click\\\" along.

All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece? Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places, houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them. You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen.

You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price.

We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities. Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen, their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me laught at you.    **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks, Arats, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation. **They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction. **You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.  The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens. They are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to kill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known by whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape, destroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity. Your own government, the Government of Greece actively supports atrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government. Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and Turkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric actions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning of 21th century???????

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller.

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman  border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman  Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who  assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman  parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces  who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname \\\"Murad\\\",  especially ordering that            'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in            whatever circumstances you find them.

Immediately, in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all  the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy  conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a  telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in  April 21, 1915, \\\"thanking it for its services to Russia.\\\" The Armenian  newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly  reported in May 24, 1915 that   \\\"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.\\\"  Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State  are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:   \\\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State  governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public  peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;  loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental  tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\\\"  Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution. The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856. Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.  The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government.  The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces.  During the Independence War, the \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" held their first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal  backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a  multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.  \\\"Major Principles of the Constitution\\\"  The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles:  - The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by    law; - It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,   human rights and the objectives of Ataturk; - The language of the State is Turkish; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.   Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This   power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else; - Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the   Turkish nation; - All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,   sex, or political beliefs; - Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.  \\\"Structure of the State\\\"  In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the principle of \\\"division of power\\\" to create a balanced and self-controlled system. The power is divided into \\\"legislative power,\\\" \\\"executive power,\\\" and \\\"judicial power,\\\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other (self-control).   A. Legislative Power:   The \\\"Turkish Grand National Assembly\\\" is a parliament with one House, elected  by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on  behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:   - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;  - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;  - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;  - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;  - to ratify international agreements;  - to grant amnesty or pardons.   Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral  or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is  divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is  calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age  of twenty-one can vote.   Elections are supervised by the \\\"Supreme Council of Elections,\\\" which solves  all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \\\"Board of Election\\\"  runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the  Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among   independent judges.   B. Executive Power:   The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government  as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:   - to represent the State and the Country;  - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;  - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;  - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;  - to ratify laws and government decrees.    The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven  years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may   call for a referendum.   Executive power is exercised by the \\\"Council of Ministers,\\\" headed by the  Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the  members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval  by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their  program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)  Ministers in the Council.   Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent  \\\"administrative\\\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or  functions against any law.   C. Judicial Power:   Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can  instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be   discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the  reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories  of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:   - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The     decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice    upon the appeal of the parties involved.  - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime    Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in    administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.    The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the    high administrative court.   The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the  \\\"Constitutional Court\\\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found  contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.   Serdar Argic\",\" Glad to hear that it's working for you!  I couldn't find it on \\\"export\\\".

Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a \\\"crosswire\\\" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\" The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated CPU plus the powercache.

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.

So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.\",\" Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.

I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.

As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.

Increasing this value increases the  amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data  structures to increase.

However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.

Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for BM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM] inflammatory half-truths.\",\"I would like to know if anyone has had any luck using the upper 128 ASCII characters on a Sun station.

My opinion, FWIW, to all:  Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his \\\"prime\\\" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"Deion Sanders hit a home run in his only AB today.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions, copyright San Jose Mercury news):  ---   Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people and  wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.         Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village,  Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles south of  Beirut.

I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000.

Chances are the government has thought of this, and \\\"just anyone\\\" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a \\\"fake\\\" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.

For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.  Andy Collins, KC6YEY acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\",\" That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\"                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          The \\\"used to kill\\\" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression. What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or a tragic accident, especially involving a child.         Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority of that 43 \\\"times\\\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone  intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill  themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns, the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not. (Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There people jump off buildings.)         According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime is commited by \\\"non-strangers,\\\" which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean, \\\"Friends and family.\\\"  That is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on the mental image that a \\\"Friend, family member, or child,\\\" equates to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives, children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by  someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun was used against a \\\"friend\\\" or family member doesn't mean they weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among poor urban families, and those are also the areas most \\\"at risk\\\" for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might.         Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses. Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers. As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense, since according to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed.         Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \\\"friend or family member\\\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in businesses.)          I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.         There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws  would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate. \",\"Please excuse my previous posting.

Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_  THERAPY INEFFECTIVE  Recently the founders of yet another prominent \\\"ex-gay\\\" ministry, Exodus International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective. Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as \\\"ineffective . . . not one person was healed.\\\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \\\"reparative therapy.\\\"  The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June 30, 1992 called \\\"The Ex-Ex-Gay\\\" by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings. Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \\\"physically\\\" forced to stay in this \\\"reparative therapy\\\" but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live, not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t a clue what is in their heart.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"We really should try to be as understanding as we can for Brad, because it appears killing is all he knows.\",\"Interestingly enough, the CDROM 300i that came with my Quadra 800 has  only 8 disks:  1.

If there is no such application, might there be some C source code that I could modify to implement the algorithm and get to the individual faces.  Thanks in advance Sincerly  Tracy\",\"  I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I don't have stats handy.\",\"Hi,  would someone please email (and post) the AVI (Microsoft) file format.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.

I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include:    have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)    Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.\",\": Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of : doing this.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1). I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.  Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the      driver for the network card?  Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers      still needed?  Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do      not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy      of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)  Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace      all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current      Win 3.1 files?  Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have      any troubles with the W4WG machines?

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.\",\" ------------ Part 5 of 14 ------------

End of part 5 of 14 --------   \",\" It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short description of the process which we use; if you have further questions, feel free to poke me via e-mail.  ================================================================ *ASSUME: locally smooth distortion  0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This    defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are    not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.    Consider deleting these edges.  1) Now, there are two goals:      a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)     b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)        as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured         using the digitized (x,y)'s).  2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For    example:      a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you        can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will        slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the        Reference(x,y).      b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.        For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge        the correct length (where \\\"correct\\\" is the DigitizedLength).         Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the        point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the        triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.  3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).  alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges.  WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and you can't allow triangles to \\\"fold over\\\" neighboring triangles.  Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using  the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having every point interact with every other point....but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem.  There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The above method is described, in more or less detail in:  @inproceedings{Sloan86, author=\\\"Sloan, Jr., Kenneth R. and David Meyers and Christine A.~Curcio\\\", title=\\\"Reconstruction and Display of the Retina\\\", booktitle=\\\"Proceedings: Graphics Interface '86 Vision Interface '86\\\", address=\\\"Vancouver, Canada\\\", pages=\\\"385--389\\\", month=\\\"May\\\", year=1986  }  @techreport{Curcio87b, author=\\\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\\\", title=\\\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\\\", number=\\\"TR 87-12-03\\\", institution=\\\"Department of Computer Science, University of Washington\\\", address=\\\"Seattle, WA\\\", month=\\\"December\\\", year=1987  }  @article{Curcio89, author=\\\"Christine A.~Curcio and Kenneth R.~Sloan and David Meyers\\\", title=\\\"Computer Methods for Sampling, Reconstruction, Display, and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts\\\", journal=\\\"Vision Research\\\", volume=29, number=5, pages=\\\"529--540\\\", year=1989  }   \",\"Just wondering if anyone had info/experience with a video/fpu for a mac LC, just thinking of adding a second monitor, most likely grayscale. \",\" Again, Mr. Frank has come to the rescue with his cool headed reason.

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).    Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered    values when working on table widgets or perhaps what    to do about?   I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.   Germans are requested to answer in german.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.  I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against  visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the field.  Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not.

C7 is not a \\\"DOS\\\"-only product -- it is a C/C++ compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial impressions have been very favorable.  Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  I own both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to  build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic. Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/ home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I  have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily: I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must  be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to  use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records  appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order) exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach  database), and then copying the exported files back to the original  filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really  like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than  the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also  takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).\",\" I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell  you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\"  Take a lemon.  Stick a copper strip into the lemon.

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  \\\"I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\\\" (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that \\\"there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.\\\" (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, \\\"there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.\\\" (Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man.

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and  idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A  short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda  and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious  for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their  neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely  within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to  x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is  the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary  heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous,  even lunatic.   And we still demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide  and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian  political pressure.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.   Now what would you do?   Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by          Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)      ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.      The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.     Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and feared dead.     The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\\\" That's when the real  slaughter began,\\\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. \\\"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\\\"     \\\" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\\\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.     One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.      The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold.     By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.     Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds.     Nor were they safe in Agdam.

They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.\",\" This is a very good point.

This is a PhD research project and I have to test the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.

Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier.

Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".

It is not comprehensive, ##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it ##for you through interlibrary loan. ##    I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)  ##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre- ##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that ##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by- ##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by ##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that, ##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to ##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the ##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored ##it)?   ##      So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from science.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into your mouth either).      But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.     Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims.  --- Vinayak -------------------------------------------------------                                            vinayak dutt                                    e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu               standard disclaimers apply\",\"You are brain damaged.

That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.  QED   --  boundary\",\" So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)   \",\"I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine (with different X paths, etc) can't find the XKeysymDB file.

Though he stepped in it, he has been very good so far about admitting he doesn't know what he's talking about, and even more stunning is that he seems\",\" I don't think such a Canada is any more \\\"culturally similar\\\" to the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ greatly from those of the United States.     Actually, they do not have \\\"roughly the same... urban economy\\\",  and extremely different ethnic composition.   However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences, the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class. The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle, while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver. The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not one of gun control.   That is a gross distortion: \\\"Self-defense\\\" does not mean killing the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their  attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that 0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed. (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure, based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000 crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other  studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000. Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences involve killing the attacker.)   So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)  cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.\",\"{drinking & riding}  0.20 is DWI in New York?  Here the limit is 0.08 !\",\"H E L P !  I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:). The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them:  - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some   number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address  Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?   I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.  Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.  Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice word Maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the liar, lunatic part.  The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?       First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"I am looking for comments from people who have used/heard about PhotoShop for Windows.

Drew\",\" Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented. Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they won't need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most  runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low  scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. \",\"   Joe;  Your logic excapes me.

Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.  After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or excommunicated.  But the Catholic Church considers us dissident.  If this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter, I'm sure OFM will let us know.

Brett himself has actually posted the data previously. What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.  As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....  During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an \\\"economist\\\" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly \\\"supply side\\\" policy, since taxes do not \\\"cause\\\"  economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be  explained by watching population waves roll through the years and  create cycles.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like   /**/#This is a makefile  at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C  preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that  I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the  line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the  start of a directive.    However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol  as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines  that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my  imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better  fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular  use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp  gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in \\\"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\\\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \\\"bad\\\" prostanoid products to \\\"good\\\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \\\"bad.\\\" Isn't this ratio the issue?  What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days?

In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".   Petri \",\"Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:    In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\"Any comments of AMD microprocessors?  good?, bad?\",\"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact     that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.  2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.  Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...  Steve --\",\"Hello,  I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called drum.zip.    I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed.  When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it is installed.    Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.

 Actually I admired the spirit of the fan at the Cubs opener several years ago who held up a sign that said \\\"Wait Till Next Year\\\". \",\"   That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.     I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.   \",\" I believe SI had an in-depth article on Moe a while ago. I remember  that the article revealed some new facts regarding the secretive  Moe.

Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?   1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh.  2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.  3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'   Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.   The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:   a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan?  b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?     This is b), of course. I suspect not.

Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator. It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).

Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)

Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read \\\"cheap\\\").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\" First of all, I'm not your buddy!  Second, read what I wrote.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\"       If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.

One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.  ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves  the coin.     Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:    Money   made   in the image   of God    I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.  The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.  Thanx again Stephen.  roy andrew crabtree\",\" Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache. It's small enough that I will attach it.  I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to 40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better.  I do not have an FPU.  The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.  If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called \\\"Performance Rating\\\" numbers by themselves are of no interest.   Cheers.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same new Jew who has \\\"learned\\\" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" have racist connotations. On the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, \\\"I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor\\\". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\",\": While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently   : when I bought a new truck. : I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   : agreed on a price.

The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls started coming.

I told them not  to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.  I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!   Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.   I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded \\\"seasoning\\\".   Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.

Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.

An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \\\"Tek-term\\\") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.

His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War.  In 1936, for example, O.

Sincerely, Gerhard\",\"MG>>  I went buying SIMMs recently, and the sales person told me that  the MG>> are 9-chip SIMMs and 3-chip SIMMs, and one cannot use them interchan MG>> If you use one, you have to use all of the same type.  don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them  between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless  they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one  bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that  the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent  configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit  nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte  ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent  because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM  interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry  if too techie for ya].   MG>>  Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to  gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ??  That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit  wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?   Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit  CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data  from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when  it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard  links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in  this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means  that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you  have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide  data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks  are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data  with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by  one SIMM at a time.

In fact, I'd say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these \\\"quacks\\\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and- destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.   *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent posts: ***************************************************  Lately I've seen the word \\\"quack\\\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \\\"quack-quack\\\" and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?  Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  \\\"quack\\\" is a nebulous word lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand. The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real scary.

Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.  The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called \\\"theosis,\\\" or \\\"deification.\\\"  One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul, and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God, their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil, its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites, and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God, not in His essence, but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.\",\"  Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \\\"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\\\" For all of you \\\"found jeezus\\\" , how many of you were \\\"on the brink?\\\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\":  : > [...]  You're not breathing clean air provided by government : > regulations, [...] :  : If this doesn't beat all I ever heard!

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)? * What are the US export regulations? * What is TEMPEST? * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax? * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch? * Is RSA patented? * What about the Voynich manuscript?   * What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?    The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and   has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,   and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified.    Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography:    ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,   one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10   years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts   between these two research communities. Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,   countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?   One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which   we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''  * What are the US export regulations?    In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export   Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule   of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent   requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.    The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what   people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR.  * What is TEMPEST?    TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at   quite a distance and with little effort.    Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext   is available this way.  * What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?    (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections.)    The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the   location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.   Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;   it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;   many documents have been tried as the key to B1.    Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:    The Beale Cypher Association   P.O. Box 975   Beaver Falls, PA 15010    You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the   line:    send index    in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.   (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,   says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)    Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of   problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.   Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this   string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an   explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this   string.  * What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?    The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes   articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in   English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,   Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.    Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;   less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent   to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.  * Is RSA patented?    Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.   For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been   granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral   issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information   about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of   the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as   ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other   technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.  * What about the Voynich manuscript?    nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the   subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list   is: <voynich-request@rand.org>    the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\",\" You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make. I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible,   Unfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV. The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many might think.    -- Scott at Brandeis\",\"ites: a The newer the drive, the less problem you will have.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually nothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about \\\"theories\\\" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I began to notice a very similar style of \\\"answers\\\" for theological questions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.  : If there are still people out there who think that my purpose here : is to \\\"attack the Bible,\\\" (an accusation Frank once made) I would point : out that I have also criticized people who have posted \\\"bible : contradictions\\\" that turn out to be silly, out of context, or easily : (and legitimately) reconciled.  I'm not attacking the Bible, but  : intellectual dishonesty *about* the Bible, from either side.  If one of the primary purposes of Christians is to seek out truth, how can people condemn you for doing this? \",\"   I answer from the position that we would indeed place these people   in prison for life.    That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but   also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability   to commit the same crimes again.    In other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work, perhaps   it's not because we're not executing these people, but because   we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up.  /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.\",\"ML> From: libman@hsc.usc.edu (Marlena Libman) ML> I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican ML> which upset me.

If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.

There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan.    If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God.    I also prefer the \\\"Creatio ex nihilo\\\" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner.    There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and we must have come from somewhere.

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially in the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14).  [stuff deleted]    True.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.     You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I will explain below.  \\\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.

(Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.)

While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues.

Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early.   Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.

Does anyone know more about this?  How much, to attend????  Anyone want to go?\",\"The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from \\\"Christians\\\".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some \\\"Christian\\\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  Creeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?   According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \\\"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\\\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).     One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the \\\"true one\\\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something \\\"correct\\\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being \\\"opened up\\\" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without. \",\"   American, perhaps, but nothing military about it.

I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again.  Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.  If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will make it happen and provide you with the details.  BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system.  This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new information.  To try it out, do the following   telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca  login: chat   Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.  --  Andrew Patrick, Ph.D.       Communications Research Centre, Ottawa, CANADA                        andrew@calvin.dgbt.doc.CA\",\"When are the Yankees planning on activating Melido Perez?

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages.

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold.

Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations.

It  is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or  of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two  postings.    Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10.

But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.

San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

CHL: Fort Worth Fire, Wichita Thunder, Dallas Freeze, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis  River Kings, Oklahoma City Blazers    Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early  November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local  interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000  salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players  are not limited to three years in the league.   A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93- 94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron  confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under  consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking  games with the Eastern Division.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9.

Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h  consists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to  hockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much  of the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.     The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi- monthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey  season.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it  during the 1991-92 season.

Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford  changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still   rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.    And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.     Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.

But why would someone pick the Dodge Stealth RT over the Nissan Sentra?  All it takes is one look. \",\"      Just a question.        As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee       intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes       with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition       for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)  The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers, they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services operated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records. As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, and they generally can confiscate the equipment as \\\"evidence\\\" (which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it. But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys for their own files without giving them to you.  Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew. The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English, and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew, and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they were able to do much about it.  It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.  \",\" I think I have updated info on this.  My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an  investigation into the use of excessive force.    The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have  happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home  to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him.  A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into  Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the  3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.\",\"Archive-name: space/mnemonics Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:14 $  ASTRONOMICAL MNEMONICS (This is the last FAQ section posted to sci.astro)      Gathered from various flurries of mnemonic postings on sci.astro.

I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.           As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.

I base this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition), almost all would want to complain.  Therefore I take it that to assert or believe that \\\"Freedom is not very valuable\\\", when almost everyone can see that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert \\\"it is not raining\\\" on a rainy day.  I take this to be a candidate for an objective value, and it it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist. \",\" I use PlugIn, an enhancement to Program Manager.

Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes with.       Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM.

One of them has an Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.  Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT, and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.  What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do the trick.  Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any.  Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again.

I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get : 985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my : transfer rate went to 830 KB/s.

Here are the rates I get:  1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec  2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec  3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec  I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like \\\"after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host\\\" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    \\\"Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.\\\"  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    \\\"Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.\\\"  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    \\\"For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\\\"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as   I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement   between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel   revise this preliminary draft as necessary:    1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform      or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female      Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but      young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of      Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further      provocation is required.    2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant      Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans      without positive identification as military personnel, clear      indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.      a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for        Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively        military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or        self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note        that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,        AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive        military identification and require closer inspection such        as document checks.      b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,        which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less        than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals        of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a        single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,        as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.        As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to        originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify        armed response.      c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive        military identification of all personnel in the target area of        the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not        be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft        are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the        papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously        civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of        uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov        coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to        land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should        first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.        For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters        is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated        if necessary.\",\"        Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is no \\\"option\\\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs: there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA). And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040. It's not an \\\"option.\\\"     Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\",\" I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

Bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines, but they were one of the groups the Nazis tried to exterminate. === In Germany, they first came for the communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. Then they came for the jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.

When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\\\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\\\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \\\"civilian\\\" status?   But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be. \",\"An excellent reference for non-technical readers on the ORION system is \\\"The Starflight Handbook\\\", by Eugene Mallove and Gregory Matloff, ISBN 0-471-61912-4.

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,  available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center  Street, Manassas, VA 22110.       [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version      of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion      technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the      panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim      Bowery]   \\\"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications\\\", by  Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\" This activity is regularly reported in Ron's interesting posts. Could someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  'sad mac' sound.   This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.

First of all looking at the titles of her other books, I would personally consider her  to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticism heavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like  _The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_).  However, other than the Chapter One into, there's nothing original, biased, or even new this book.  It is basically a collection of previously published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu stories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa)  during the period from late teens to age 30.  Conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting a summary of various published works and letters, all of which you could verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works as well.

It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.

TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\\\"    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   \\\"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\\\"    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

I consider myself married, though legally I am not.  Neither of us have been with other people sexually, although we have been with each other.  We did not have sexual relations until we decided to marry eventually.  For financial and distance reasons, we will not be legally married for another year and a half.  Until then, I consider myself married for life in God's eyes.  I have faith that we have a strong relationship, and have had for over 4 years, and will be full of joy when we marry in a church.  First, however, we must find a church( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to find a new church community).  Anyway, I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God, they are married and are bound by that commitment. \",\"I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back (a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.      I'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.  COD orders must pay all shipping and COD costs.

Best offer over $75 ($30 less than my cost and they are both brand new).  ---------------------------------- CUT HERE ----------------------------------       Jeez!!!

Oh wait, you chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact  OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  the borders could be expanded.      Steve -- \",\" Nathan,   Win31 has a fixed limit of 64K GDI memory, regardless of physical RAM installed, this is twice that of Win30, but not nearly robust enough for many developers and power users.   Using Amish Launch as your shell, you can reduce GDI memory usage by as much as 15% over Progman, NDW 2, DAshboard, and other graphical type icon based and other shells.  Also, nesting, and full hot-key global support is offered, something no other shells have at this time.   Ted Matsumura, President Amish Software, Inc.\",\"  Well, you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli  patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the \\\"retaliatory\\\" shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli-backed forces. My \\\"team\\\", you see, was \\\"playing fair\\\" while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak.   I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. There are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in  retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the Lebanese
