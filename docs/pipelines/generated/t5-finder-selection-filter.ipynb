We have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.  As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither \\\"white\\\" nor \\\"black,\\\" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on.  Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because \\\"Ethiopia\\\" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \\\"There is no way out of the loop.\\\"   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because   However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:   I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.    But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only \\\"very confident\\\" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein. \",\"The Apollo astronauts also trained at (in) Meteor Crater in the Flagstaff area (Arizona).

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point.

The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \\\"I18N.h\\\"  extern \\\"C\\\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.  In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question. Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to here.

While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy.   Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \\\"extra-scientific\\\", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \\\"surprising\\\" experiment is, what counts as \\\"surprising\\\", etc. The same may be said about \\\"logical grounds\\\".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \\\"sea of air\\\" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \\\"surprising\\\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \\\"perfectly rational grounds\\\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \\\"new\\\"?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like.\",\" Definitely!

I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to  think about my Honda.  She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike  week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and  was running only on one cylinder.  I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect  working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look  very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All  still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a  slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem),  but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for  this bike.  Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone  the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in  order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the  wear of my pistons??

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \\\"AT     keyboard standard\\\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?

In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\"  How about your two big toes?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"(NOTE: cross-posted to alt.politics.italy and talk.politics.misc  This is a reply to an article by Ed Ipser which also appeared in  alt.politics.usa.misc and alt.politics.libertarian, but no longer belongs)   I hate to defend Ed (the article was very poorly written) but here goes:   Italy's per-capita debt is much higher than USA's.

Who knows.  (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)  Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians are tired of having crappy government.

Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said.  It gives us almost nothing of value, threatens to take away a lot, and does it with a sincere smile on its face, and the nice friendly word \\\"Management\\\".           FACT SHEET        PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT  The first thing it doesn't say is \\\"We're giving you stronger encryption\\\". what it says is     the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only    provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust    than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of    the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the    escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to    encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization. But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now, so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key.  Similarly, it didn't say \\\"We're making encryption is commercially available.\\\" because encryption *is* already commercially available, including forms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA. And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.  The next thing it didn't say is \\\"We're making encryption legal\\\", because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the President can't change the First Amendment merely by decree. What it *did* say was:  In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the  private sector from developing, or the government from approving,  other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in  assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system. which clearly means \\\"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys. Soon.  Once business buys into this.\\\"  Another thing it didn't say is \\\"We're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping\\\", because of course, there's a budget crisis, and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash. What it *did* say was:    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to    the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure    law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. which means \\\"We've got money Congress can't control and we're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO (that's what \\\"preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance\\\"  means.)  \",\"    You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and    there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that    I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\"    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.    Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\",\"  Make that 20%.  Where did I see that poll recently about the very religious and adultery?

Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\"Hi netters,  I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field.

[Would I kid you?]   Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression.  I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior  of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor. I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order  for many years.  Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.   Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....  \\\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.   Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death, Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic.   \\\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O.  \\\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership. For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh, the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox.  \\\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O. over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order. He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\\\"  _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'  Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by    Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,     Caliph of the United States of America,       Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.    There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations.  It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.  Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?   Will I?   I think not. Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first.  So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully. I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?   I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis. They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.   Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands.  I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments  I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes.    This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however. I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members.  I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision.  I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread.   Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.

The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system.

What do you think ol' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  So Mary comes up with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.  Actually, it can't be all THAT ridiculous, considering the number of people that believe it.  Anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells poor little Jesus that he's hot shit, the Son of God.  Everyone else tells him this too, since they've bought Mary's story.  So, what does Mary actually turn out to be?  An adultress and a liar, and the cause of mankind's greatest folly...  Just my recently-minted two cents.  Chris \",\"I have a CASIO B.O.S.S.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the \\\"passenger car division\\\" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)\",\"(excess stuff deleted...)

Chances are the government has thought of this, and \\\"just anyone\\\" won't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a \\\"fake\\\" clipper chip. Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.  While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation. Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little chance of getting a clearance.

Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.

Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\" : Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain : chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a : cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is : a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.

I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from \\\"Christians\\\".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some \\\"Christian\\\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  Creeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?   According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states:      In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities:    devotion to the apostles teaching    fellowship    communion    filling with awe for God    all having everything in common.    glad and sincere hearts    praising God    enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \\\"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit\\\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).     One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the \\\"true one\\\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something \\\"correct\\\" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being \\\"opened up\\\" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without. \",\"[..] Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a  'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these beeps.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.

If it's the latter, then they won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files, there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime movies, perhaps?)

They don't have a real closer -- although Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken. Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is  unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.      From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the club.

Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"Hi everyone,  I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming  in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep  getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the  program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes.  All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\"I am a newbie to the net, and I am trying to get some information for a paper I am working on to get back into college.

Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \\\"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\\\"  In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.  For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!)  If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\",\"Dumbest options? Well here in the UK, BMW offer a 'no-smokers' option...

EDT                     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you  in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking  part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.              You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas  Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to  mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he  has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all  followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education  here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according  to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational  system.              His philosophy of government, his belief in the  importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest  here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us  President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in  the Chamber of Commerce studios.                Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for  taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite  network and we welcome you here this evening.              Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.   And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening  also.              I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure  many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that  you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In  Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.              I believe the President has a few words that he might  want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that  at this time.  It's great to have you.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.              I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob  Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the  Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,  along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine  tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people  from school to the work place.              I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,  recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this  economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to  work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to  make things happen.              This satellite town meeting is a good example of that  kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home  state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart  Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing  several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I  appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all  the rest of you.              I have tried as hard as I could to move toward  constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about  this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson  believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in  education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,  freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and  third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.                If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this  beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful  cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change  with changing times.              For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit  and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we  can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless  we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in  government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase  our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the  long run.              We also have to have people who can carry their load.   And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven  or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system  and continues into the work force where education must go on for a  lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can  learn.              And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing  we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership  between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the  private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're  trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that  would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many  thousands that have a strong education component so our young people  can be learning and working at the same time.              Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good  place we can begin, I think, the discussion.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.              Each month we get together and talk about ways that all  citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And  tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours  can prepare students for this world of work.              This week, the Education Department and the Labor  Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called  Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.   The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's  proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched  jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged  areas of the country.                Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it  somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls  for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your  words is that so important?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.   First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may  have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want  them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to  continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of  research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may  forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year  over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for  schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already  taught before.              Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,  not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to  abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is  learning because we think that the best and most productive workers  will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience  could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to  succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are  disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go  into the next year, is really even greater.                Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs  throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this  educational component of training.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.  Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer  or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with  education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,  for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning  geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or  working on something, and they can see the exact and direct  application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a  lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between  education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.   It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of  young people even beyond the summer.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.                Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship  program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell  us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it  developing.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why  it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade  will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will  require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people  get in a high school diploma.                If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries  of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school  education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young  people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not  go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because  they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their  employers.              So we think America has a big economic interest in  trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school  but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes  two years of further training either in a community college, a  vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in  this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some  funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states  and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in  a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,  based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could  revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and  the earnings of American workers.              SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think  you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the  people watching this program -- that the business community and  educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many  of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In  fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The  people watching this program probably are the ones who are most  directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley  and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes  already out there.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight  about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning   career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal  with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of  these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and  you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much  longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business  community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're  doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The  Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these  kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've  aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.              The business community is going to be actively engaged  in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and  helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions  develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.              Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is  one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these  players in a community come together and work together and cooperate  together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and  the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody  is talking, but they're not really working together in a common  strategy.              And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,  would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic  excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a  tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to  make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be  eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year  college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're  talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation  skills for on-the-job learning.              And again, those are the critical components.  It's  already being done.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one  point based on my personal experience at home -- the business  community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are  the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,  but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort  of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are  going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the  second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and  influence them.  So I think that's very important.              And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at  the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some  funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make  sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the  quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to  determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.              SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of  course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery  program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about  long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.  President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the  communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be  coming forth before too long.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I  were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public  schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that  a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.                I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals  that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President  Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to  do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in  Congress that will actually define the things that the national  government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the  children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those  goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school  ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school  graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are  confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are  second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,  disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took  them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of  life-long learning in this country.              And each one of those goals there's a national role, a  state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector  role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to  introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;  and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job  is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality  that we need to meet.              It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite  like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.   Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their  money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and  partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really  it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms  of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to  support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform  efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.              Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to  the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of  course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and  I wonder if you would comment on that.              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of  our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they  don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system  of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had  national skill standards to which they could aspire and which  employers would understand as a national credential, many of these  young people would actually find that they were much more eligible  for jobs.              Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other  countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to  college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain  technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If  you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to  develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working  with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private  industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the  kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other  institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go  ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce  Todd of Austin, Texas.              Q   Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and  Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We  have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who  have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me  simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with  much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are  very supportive.                We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our  summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to  have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much  as 3,500 with the federal assistance.                Much of the question that we had designed you have  answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But  the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day  would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round  is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal  level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the  local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's  something that we believe is very important to success in this  effort.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.              THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to  answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,  and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.   I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.                First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can  structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer  program and that will move a lot of these young people back into  schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in  the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to  try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs  to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're  working on that.              Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the  Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to  build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job  training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give  heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you  asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we  hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being  trained on a year-round basis.              And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said  a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen  as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people  actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when  they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we  hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and  we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget  cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue  raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be  able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.              Bob, do you want to say anything?              SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out  of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,  and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high  school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in  addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of  jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.   It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the  economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything  else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I  think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I  think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or  greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going  to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything  right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000  will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into  next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it  will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working  together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And  then the state, with all the various school districts, a very  important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I  think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that  moving.              The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.                Doctor?              Q   Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to  be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school  and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since  its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two  alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages  we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an  extremely effective learning strategy.              And over the years, we've come to believe that there are  several principles that are very important in bridging the school and  work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with  practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure  to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect  upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and  lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the  development of high performance competencies.                My question, then is:  How can the general education  faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with  transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies  can you suggest to achieve this integration?              SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --  and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting  work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next  guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists    in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to  them and we can discuss it later.              You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?              THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one  thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as  clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the  people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more  explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics  is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish  what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is  vocational learning and what is academic learning.              I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think  we should have a strong component for people who are in the  vocational program.              SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to  rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and  work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're  important for all students.  It's not just a special group of  students that needs them.              Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United  States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream  experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and  12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience  and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on  to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they  can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and  career directions.              But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often  goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom, within our schools.              SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's  going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I  think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank  you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and  your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \",\"}first I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing), }but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.

Clinton`s e-mail address. thanks a lot      \",\" After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals, but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they  should not; they should keep it proprietary.   The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would  authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15  years.  We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by any of these.  Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the public scrutiny.  (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to  gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis of authority alone.)  We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can \\\"break\\\" the DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they can \\\"break\\\" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in what time.  The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way. At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.  DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.

One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse.

Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\"I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"In today's Israeline posting, at the end (an afterthought?), I read:   While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza, in order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration since 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)?

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"Acorn Software, Inc. has 3 tape drives (currently used on a VMS system) for sale.

The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire \\\"problem\\\" as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East, and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his \\\"even-handed\\\" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what  he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine: rectification of the \\\"abnormal presence\\\" of the Jewish people within a  larger body politic.  Whether your \\\"solution\\\" involves gas, monetary  incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has  said, \\\"disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal  surrounding Arab culture,\\\" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \\\"paid advertising\\\" but rather \\\"public relations\\\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \\\"advertising\\\" as much as it is \\\"public relations\\\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \\\"public relations\\\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \\\"The Last Action Hero\\\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \\\"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\\\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \\\"commercial launch\\\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL \\\"BILLBOARDS\\\"    Orbital \\\"billboards\\\" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\\".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \\\"Eiffel II\\\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

Boy, you computer people only know 1s and 0s, but not much about logic. :-)  No. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.    If you want to convict MSG, show me the evidence, not quilty by suspicion.   Nobody is forcing you to change what you believe.  But I certainly don't want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him/her sneeze. That is exactly what some anti-MSG activitiests are doing   Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant. I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.  What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing:             ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.   My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered.\",\"Well,I tried not to get involved in this never ending talk,but,man,I REALLY got hot about this bullshit.

Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?\",\" [Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]   CHIP STRUCTURE  The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption  algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared  with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16  for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

Consider two vertices, p and q, which are connected by at least one edge.  If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.

Flip those which        are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as \\\"OK\\\",        and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially        inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)).      2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).  If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.  If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you lose.       Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.

Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"Hi all: Does anyone know where I can get the cheapest price for the Teleport Gold fax modem by Global Village?

Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.  Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding.   If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However, I think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach. This is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do anything.'  Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.  Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity. There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles. Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to  tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.  Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government  is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.   And I'm just excercising mine.   As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*. A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight. I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible self-sufficient populace.     They didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in less than a day.   Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of every person on the planet.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their passports can't enter arabic countries?  2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be?  3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?  4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  4a. Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?  4b. Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, prohibit women from driving cars?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?  6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?  8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000 deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?  9.  Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax, for being Jews?  10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?  11. Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions?  11a. Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Astrophys.,  239, pp. 375-380, 1990). --    -------------------------------------------------------------\",\"   There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.  For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\"  I don't think we need to argue about this.   Yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs.  And actually, I think that the government already does recognize that Christianity is the dominant religion in this country.  I mean, it is. Don't you realize/recognize this?  This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of Christianity, just that most people do.   If you agree with me, then what are we discussing?   No, but I hear quite a bit about Christmas, and little if anything about Jesus.  Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to a high degree with him?  Or are you saying that the association with Jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it?  That is, can *you* prove that most people *do* associate Christmas most importantly with Jesus?   I think the numbers *do* matter.

The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious  consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.    For example, does \\\"non-initiated force\\\" (coercion) include tax collection? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion?     Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a  complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out,  however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group  of \\\"seminar participants\\\" to \\\"embrace\\\" their philosophy, their  propaganda skills need to be honed.    Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a  society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said, the state will just wither away.    On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating  virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the  current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until  everyone has had the benefit of \\\"re-education\\\" through regular  \\\"seminar\\\" training?  jsh \",\"Sorry, ARF - you dog,  That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team repeatedly spiked it.

Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of the majority can ensue from \\\"popular\\\" opinion, a concept which you should be familiar with from the Federalist papers.\",\" That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.

I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not because of *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions  lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.    @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.

As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.

If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.

The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.  You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how can you say you have an open mind?   Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a good life.   Please do.   I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in which case it's not really all that important.  Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right. \",\" Ah, there's the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.  You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line.  I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its not 'wasted' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500 million, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.

Was that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  [accident deleted]    You can forget this line of reasoning.  When an animal decides to take you, there's nothing you can do about it.  It has something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in, just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my shotgun I'd still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more manueverable dog.  Just run them over.\",\" There's an article in Motorcycling a couple of months back specifically on   women's attire for serious and not-so-serious riding.

While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply.  Sherlette   P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  \\\"It doesn't matter what color His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts.\\\"  This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for saying that \\\"it doesn't matter...\\\"  to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT MATTERS.\",\"   Yes, I do.      My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?    Were you to pin me in a corner and ask, I would have to respond   that I don't belief the state should have the right to take life   at all.  But I won't open that debate, as it seems others are   tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.   /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.\",\" To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter.\",\" An effort was made to remove the sticker.  It came to pieces, leaving most of it firmly attached to the window.  It was dark, and around 10:00 pm.  The sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  A \\\"reasonable person\\\" would arguably have driven the car.  Had an accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.  As a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.  As a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (BTW, it wasn't \\\"somebody's\\\" spot, it was resident-only, but unassigned, parking).

After reading the text some distinct questions arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?    shorter or longer ?     First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such a bad idea ?    Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret, or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?  It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time, your government realy means to act. :-(  Friendly greetings,     Germano Caronni \",\"I am looking for some bar code fonts especially code 3 of 9.

I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and \\\"marriage\\\" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.          I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?  \",\"  Do you happen to know what a .SCO RIX file is? \",\"I'm greatly in need of Jurgen Moltmann's book God in Creation: An Ecological Doctrine of Creation.

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106\",\"I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or something.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.

Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\",\" Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Enough said.    /(emery) /Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest. /We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that /these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly /believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event. /And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant  /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.  Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof of any of this happening.  It just isn't there.  Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not make your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now; does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is the correct religion?     (emery) /History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius  /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to  /the torture of Christians in Rome:   All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  That does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they were sincere in their beliefs.   Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth. It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture; Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions are harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far.    /(emery) /With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it /would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy /would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.    Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.     /(emery) /Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make /up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen /from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those /who believed.  The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koran says Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for their beliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct, then that means Islam is the true faith.\",\" Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how to make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives to put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(    Don't know whether you could get busted for warning of a speedtrap.

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"   Sorry, I was, but I somehow have misplaced my diskette from the last  couple of months or so.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied, caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry D. Westbrook:  \\\"The change was immediately justified by the increased industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.\\\"  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort.\\\"  Bradford did not blame this failure on the \\\"strangers\\\", but on the basic selfishness in all men.  He wrote \\\"seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.\\\"  In other words, according to Westbrook, \\\"Bradford found private enterprise to be the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.\\\"  Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings starvation, poverty and discontent.\",\"  You can try defraging your disk more often. It definitely will  help speed things up.

Sorry about that.  #8 LARRY DEPALMA  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Minnesota Grade:  I (C-/D+)  No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round   pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade:  A/A-  After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5' 11\\\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15 DAVID BRUCE  Season: 5th Acquired: '91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade:  I (?)  After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18 MARK PEDERSON  Season: 3rd Acquired: '92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade:  I (B)  It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20 JOHN CARTER  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, free agent from Boston Grade:  I (B+/B)  Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+/B)  I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41 MARK BEAUFAIT  Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade:  I (?)  After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (?)  Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44 MICHEL PICARD  Season: 1st Acquired: '92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade:  I (B-/C+)  The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the expansion draft.  #45 DODY WOOD  Season: 1st Acquired: 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade:  I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)  I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\\\", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\",\"A slightly used (less than two months old) SupraFaxModem is for sale.

Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.

He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.

(\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!

(In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)

After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting.  *** file follows ***   Hi Folks;  As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.  Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).  Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.  Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\" some deleted   Dear Will,  I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok. I had a few thoughts!:  \\\"Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead\\\" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says \\\"We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands\\\" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.

But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip, one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that break gives you all messages involving that phone.)     The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I. Eachus\",\"  How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.  In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray- way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today. He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and Quinn in my estimation.  I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.\",\"From article <1993Apr18.001319.2340@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu>, by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:  It certainly is provable.  Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

No fancy modulation scheme, just wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver \\\"back end\\\" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a normal IF filter can be used?  Any suggestions?

I have everything under control, I think, besides the batteries. I know that if I buy a $50.00 Battery Tender for each one and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage, they'll be fine. But I'm not sure that's necessary. I've never heard anyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't so great. But maybe someone can tell me.  Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the electrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the container, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged. What's wrong with this?

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).

GO REDBIRDS!!\",\"Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy- theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist  support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People  are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.         Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his  conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.     Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.  I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated  political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the \\\"right\\\" things (where \\\"right\\\" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement) is showing an acute case of \\\"myopic social perspective\\\", not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity.  Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public.    Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated  like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic  people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the \\\"oughta-be's\\\" inside their own hopelessly closed minds.     OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific incident.     Hmmm, \\\"Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\\"  Liberal translation: \\\"the federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays, while prohibiting others.\\\"  I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.  Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.    [Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted]    Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their good fortune?     This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh  is the populist nemesis of that movement.  I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain \\\"venom\\\" at all, let alone \\\"venom\\\" comparable to an individual who callously murdered millions out of racism.     A very serious tone in that oratory.     You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,  BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention  that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions. He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much). This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.  I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and needed to be exterminated.     This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of the Aryan as \\\"the highest image of the Lord\\\" fits with Christian doctrine.     Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here.     Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here.    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control  of Hollywood.  90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control  of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an early age the \\\"right\\\" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.  Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the \\\"young heads full of mush\\\" hyperbole indicates.     Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.     Indication here that \\\"Elements of the Media\\\" (since career is a self-selected categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable. No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.  You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable  opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his  audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that  purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree  or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who  is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?  Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media.              It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance. Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind, not the real world.     Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.  As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings. Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through \\\"business/government partnership\\\" and increased levels of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school.     Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear  racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal  Left.  The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to  that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush  Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than  the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it is a part of it.     Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them within their borders?    [...]  You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\" Yea, it turned out that Gramm-Rudman was a sham to fool the voters into accepting the borrow-and-spend policies of the last 12 years.         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit cards.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies. \",\" Wow.  ESPN can repeat eleven-year-old Bill James research.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X, I have  noticed two new problems:  * if I create a windowed MS-DOS session (386 mode), when the text starts     to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print    horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire     display.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.

It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.

One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.

You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year     I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the     same inquiry as you.       Age: 24 (then and now)     Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD     Driving Record: Clean     State: Illinois     Cost: $820/6 mos.       I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.     Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.       I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more     than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.       Hope the info helps.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.  The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).  It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe accurately what happens in the real world.  \",\"       Beleive it or not:  NY state once considered eliminating tolls for motor- cycles based simply on the fact that motos clog up toll booths.  But then Mario realized the foolishness of trading a few hundred K $`s a year for some relief in traffic congestion.  Too bad he won`t take that Sumpreme Court Justice job - I thought we might be rid of him forever.\",\"   There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\" my understanding was that ted turner (owner of the braves) started running his tv station nationwide, and started running all of his team's games on his nationwide tv station, he dubbed his team ''america's team'' - that is, the only team (at least, at the time) all of whose games could be seen across america.  now, wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus, but not all mets games are on wor.  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations (at least, they are on the east coast).  i don't know how many cubs/sox/sox games they show.  --hymie                                                     hymowitz@cs.jhu.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll be mellow when I'm dead.                           --''Weird'' Al Yankovic ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You get your mellow, laid back attitude from Sonny the Cuckoo Bird.                                                                --Josh, about me\",\" Just as a not of possible interest on this subject ..

Grazing in a couple of  databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities along this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can  determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of  the articles are appended.        This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than  the US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and  why?

In Japanese, with abstract in English.      This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS (experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13, 1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <---- satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <---- optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <---- useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <---- stages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <---- two satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----   MU radar measurements of orbital debris SATO, TORU; KAYAMA, HIDETOSHI; FURUSAWA, AKIRA; KIMURA, IWANE (Kyoto University, Japan) AIAA, NASA, and DOD, Orbital Debris Conference: Technical Issues and  Future Directions, Baltimore, MD, Apr. 16-19, 1990. 10 p.  RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343      Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross  section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data  processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of  orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail  echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary,  they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <---- observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <---- collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an  altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as  once per two years.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication Date: Jun. 1986       As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere  troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar  features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large  VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  and results are discussed. \",\"Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals. (Hey, look who's #4!)

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev e disk), I choosed Bernoulli drive. I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies alot. you ran out of storage real fast.  IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk. 150MB per cartridge\",\"  Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try and make it apply to events 20 centuries later. \",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                            BY DEE DEE MYERS                                   The Briefing Room   9:45 A.M. EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.\",\"Hi guys.  I am scanning in a color image and it looks fine on the screen.  When I  converted it into PCX,BMP,GIF files so as to get it into MS Windows the colors got much lighter.  For example the yellows became white.

Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'. Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)   \",\"1975 H-1 500      Brand new top end      Chambers      Clean + black!      1,500$      Paul: (510) 839-2161  Please do not contact this email address: contact the seller.

Giving the man $40 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the safety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away.   I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.  Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth. But I think third or fourth place is more likely.\",\"Gee, I guess they should also have such a repository for house keys, car keys, safety deposit keys, ... :-(  rdl\",\"henrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the henrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan.   BM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It BM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do      want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.  BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment, BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.   BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?     Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many         cases, HISTORY repeats itself.   BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes  BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in BM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.

Methinks Horner had no work ethic before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped. But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.  \",\"  I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.   I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there).

In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"  I agree.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\" \",\"1985.5 Porsche 944      - Turbo trim (spoilers)     - graphite black     - all around excellent condition     - removable factory sunroof     - leather interior     - new A/C     - new timing belt     - bra     - 90k miles  $9900 OBO  - Patrick \",\"This article was probably generated by a buggy news reader. \",\"If you'd like to find a home for that beekeeping equipment you'll never use again, here's a likely victim, uh, customer.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

Douglas noted, \\\"If a powerful sponsor is lacking, individual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and resounding constitutional phrases.\\\"   The legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee, committee, and floor action.  Many important victories, however, come from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting legislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted. These quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.     ****   Arizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in criminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currently awaiting action by the Governor.

Florida - A bill to require a 3-year license at a cost of $150 to own or possess semi-automatic firearms with a second degree felony provision (15 years in prison) died in committee along with numerous other anti-gun owner bills.  No anti-gun legislation passed in Florida this year.   Georgia - SB 12, supposed instant check with provision allowing for up to a 7-day \\\"waiting period,\\\"  defeated in House Public Safety Committee and sent to Interim Study committee.  Mandatory storage bill -- SB 247 -- was defeated 39-15 in the Senate.  The same bill passed the upper-House 52-2 in 1992.     Illinois - HB 90, prohibiting the sale, possession, manufacture, purchase, possession, or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms, was defeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 91, mandatory storage legislation, failed in House Judiciary Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 1550, repeals FOID and makes FTIP, point of sale check permanent, passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote. Presently on the calendar for third reading in the House.   SB 40, mandatory storage bill, defeated in committee. SB 265, imposing a handgun excise tax, failed in Senate committee on Revenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.

West Virginia - S.C.R. 18, which calls for a study to control transfers of handguns and \\\"Assault Weapons\\\" was defeated in the Senate 24-10.   Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determined efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in Madison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban -- aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the referendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to reverse public opinion on the controversial issue.   An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found 57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By election day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls, 51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign committee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA, relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.   Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison initiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

I don't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that  the borders could be expanded.      Steve -- \",\" From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip  system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key  management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system  unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in  their data base?  This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key  algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is  rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that  could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.     As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they  need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont  have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed. They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without  court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on  their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways possible.\",\"         As a data point from Tennessee, a friend of mine and a police officer essentially recommends that if you can, fade away.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .  The Particulars:  * Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.

I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: \\\"probably incorrect\\\") terminology!    Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process is started by xdm.    i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to      display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!       The setup is as follows:          lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc         ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc                                     tvtwm       There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home      directory.       The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm      login window as expected - very nice!       Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as      expected.       The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the      the users session startup?   ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.       ie: real key       key shown on screen          ------------   -------------------          hash           back slash          tilde          pipe          double quote   at symbol          pound          hash          cursor key     not recognised       This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have      installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.       Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as      expected!    Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .        kind regards,\",\"Does any one know if the 6551 is timing/pin compatible with the 6551..

The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was. Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe  he did make the sun stand still.   Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right away. Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  real thing.    --\",\" Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base. They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!   \\\"A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his  recent offensive level of performance.\\\"  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in  the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger  in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived \\\"superstars\\\", who  get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably  considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.    Aren't they the same thing?   Either that or just stupidity.   Of course.   One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media magnet).

For the last couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms, or at least very similar.

I believe this is the way most teams design their uniforms. \",\" I've seen them in surplus stores.  All they are are fluorescent bulbs  without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I've also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC socket, probably not what you want.   As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope) exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.  Hope this helps.

   Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire  seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\" Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the chip?  (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet)  Skipjack sounds like a normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be  voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt  Compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless they want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...).  Feeding pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream before it hits the modem.  Unless you want to pay for two fast modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between your phone and the wall. \",\"I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share.  The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\"James Sledd asks:   1. What is the nature of eternal life?  2. How can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it?  2a.

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the \\\"experts\\\".

PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.

I don't see how this is a problem.  \",\": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged : couple become \\\"married\\\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"I've recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I'd like to do some C programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me access the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C?\",\"  If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time without losing memory)  It is also compatible with the chat program \\\"FishBomb\\\" which allows sounds and pictures as well.

Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about    that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10    billion won't be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term 'center tax'.

They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.\\\"  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question \\\"What is the government doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)\\\"  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? Talk about a burecratic nightmare!\",\"Source: \\\"Men Are Like That\\\" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill.

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.

CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize \\\"scroll\\\" and \\\"zoom\\\";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.

First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the \\\"axioms\\\" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\"I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now.

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than PC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run Ami Pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a)  segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all times after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module AMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem except by reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times being after having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stacker or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know, PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.\",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

Maybe they're using the exportable version of RC2...? :-)\",\" Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.     I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\" I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style \\\"values-free\\\" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make \\\"choices\\\", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?  \",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\" During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in this regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different story...every good team is going to have players who are going to become potted plants in front of Potvin...and the Leafs relatively unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.  Hard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost to 100 points...and the Leafs deserve credit for that...but in the  playoffs talent matters, because everyone begins working hard.\",\"hand.  Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room. Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money. Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate.  Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.  Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys. One of magazine writer called it \\\"Land Bruiser\\\".

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's what the user wants.  With Glocks, one says \\\"I want the gun to go off\\\" by pulling the trigger.

I would like to know if anyone could suggest books, periodicals, even ftp sites for a novice who is interested in the space program.  \",\" No one else seems to know, so I'll post this.  This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?  Paul.\",\" I have a simple test. I take several people who can speak only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english). Then I let the \\\"gifted one\\\" start \\\"speaking in toungues\\\". The audience should understand the \\\"gifted one\\\" clearly in their native language. However, the \\\"gifted one\\\" can only hear himself speaking in his own language.  Works everytime. 8-) Perhaps I would believe the \\\"gifted ones\\\" more if they were glorifying God rather than themselves. Then perhaps we'd witness a real miracle.  -- \",\"-> > But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large -> > group of poeple twice a year.

Since these representatives feel an unconditional  interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority of the people feel the same way.

The bike has about 47,000 miles : and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees : of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the : bike.  : I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this : would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life : span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with : prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is : for cars?.  : Thanks for any advice you can give.  :                             --Mark --  Mark,    47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.  Good luck,\",\"One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate. If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.  A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth. Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location.  \",\"     Whoah  whoah  whoah  WHOAH!!!   What?!?

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Arafat explicitly *denies* this claim.   from a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 7-19-1991 Q: Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed    its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the    Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front.  The    [strategies and tactics] have not been clear.  The question is, is the    direction of the Palestinian problem clear?  The Palestinian leadership    has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this    happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO    recognized something called \\\"Israel\\\"...  A: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said    \\\"recognition\\\" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then    decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its    parliament will convene and decide.    And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.   Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations. These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides.   Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again, they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"   While religion certainly has some benefits in a combat situation, what are the benefits of cocaine?\",\"For Sale:   2 Amigas!

Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him, including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.\",\"    Yeah, Simon's no rat-bastard, he's the Head Attack Puppy :-)   \",\"According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few others have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.

The limit has a five year moratorium on it, and \\\"specialist\\\" manufacturers will be exempt anyway.

If you want to look at non-christian sources try Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.   This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)   When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights that they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example friends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God willing).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to decide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology is against God's revealed word.  Regards  David\",\" As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive \\\"T\\\" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \\\"Make before break and Vica Versa\\\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \\\"optical isolator\\\".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a \\\"T\\\" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior.  What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out rate, and no side effects associated with medication.  Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled \\\"Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and a review of controlled studies.\\\"  This is from Behav. Res. Ther., vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987.  The article provides instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).
