     Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \\\"When it's time to railroad, you railroad.\\\"     Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again. However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be shared.     The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked. \",\"Davis will be paid by three clubs this year, I think the Phils are responsbible for about $600,000 or so.

Something like this would require more attention by the referee.   But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not have been one before.  I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with.  Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was, that play was stopped too often. Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game?\",\": I need to know the Pins to connect to make a loopback connector for a serial : port so I can build one.

Here is some  information \\\"from the horse's mouth\\\".  (Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\\\"clearing\\\") meant to  be *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying  the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)  From National Telecommunications and Information Systems  Security (NTISS) \\\"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation  Security Guidelines\\\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):  ------  \\\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk,  cassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the  entire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be  cleared by applying a vendor's formatting program that overwrites  each location with a given character.  Fixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting  at least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by  applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each  location on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that  this program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware:  some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not  actually do this.  Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or  released for destruction; however, they should be marked and  controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of  information ever recorded.  7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media  Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a  degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of  that type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)  If a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is  operative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to  employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all  addressable locations at least three times by writing any character,  then its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros)  alternatively.

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.

I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasn't very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.  9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke. 10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave. they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons)> \",\"  james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts! never was a t'bird mentioned.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.   First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars, other than timing belt failures.   If your friend \\\"beats\\\" on the car, then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's reliability.

Thanks \",\" There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).    I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.   Ken\",\"Hi..

I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.\",\" Nah.

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\"--- Received from EEI.EEIIHY  353-1-2800455         93-04-26 12.28   -> VAX.XPERT..EXPO.LCS.MIT.EDU..INET   -: - - - - - - - - - - > MAIL USER IN VAX AND INTERNET help  \",\" It is obvious that Mr. Cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'.

This doesn't mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority.  The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.   Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT.  I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather, colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's called under X11R5).  If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer.  Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client, this flashing could also be avoided.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.  For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you add preventative services and this reduces acute care use, then the total premium may fall.\",\"Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people?

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.  The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \\\"evil\\\" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents \\\"sawed off\\\" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated \\\"good faith\\\" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an \\\"offensive action\\\" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.  The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a \\\"regular supplier\\\").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to \\\"look at the body\\\" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.  Prosecution quote: \\\"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation.\\\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist  Defense quote: \\\"The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.\\\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]  Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including \\\"Tim\\\" again.  \\\"Tim\\\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \\\"ordinary, working class people.\\\"  He also claimed he was for \\\"white pride, not white power.\\\"  Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.  In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \\\"sawed off\\\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!).  Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.  Drew =============================================================  \",\"Sorry to waste the bandwidth.

Thomas   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+  \",\"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \\\"in X's name\\\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business \\\"in John's name\\\" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with \\\"in John's name\\\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of \\\"faith\\\".)  With this cultural background, praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous \\\"fiduciary\\\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of \\\"praying in Jesus' name\\\" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying \\\"in Jesus' name\\\" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words \\\"In Jesus' Name\\\" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)

This means that the CPU doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS just sits and waits anyway.   Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is* ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.  This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.

(In the base 13 system, of course.)  \",\"  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists \\\"believe\\\" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\" Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars being European.    Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly too.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)    In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.  Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.  Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.)) So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America.   I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those players were the among the best in the world.

I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with  kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  \\\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of \\\"progress\\\" and \\\"rationality\\\" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the \\\"correct\\\") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes \\\"forward\\\" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the \\\"critical function\\\" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any \\\"critical function\\\" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an \\\"anything goes\\\" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\",\"   Why \\\"must\\\"?  ---           \\\" Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. \\\"\",\"    Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this irrelevant?

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ? ------------------------------------  While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans.  The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.  While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.  The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors.  As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for the Master Race.  The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators.  As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve ?  I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

Yes, even other people share the food.   Boy, you computer people only know 1s and 0s, but not much about logic. :-)  No. I did not said MSG was not the culprit. What I argued was that that there was enough reasonable doubt to convict MSG.    If you want to convict MSG, show me the evidence, not quilty by suspicion.   Nobody is forcing you to change what you believe.  But I certainly don't want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him/her sneeze. That is exactly what some anti-MSG activitiests are doing   Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant. I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.  What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing:             ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''  And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.  Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group, some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.

Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they won't need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most  runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low  scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. \",\" Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your \\\"proof\\\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \\\"prove\\\" nothing.  Scholars speak of the \\\"weight of evidence.\\\"  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \\\"prove\\\" your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to \\\"prove\\\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying \\\"I am right because I say so.\\\"    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where \\\"fundamentalist\\\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe \\\"inerrant\\\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers  To: National Desk, Defense Writer  Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States, 202-479-2258     WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel.    ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested \\\"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\\\"    He asked the commission \\\"to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action.\\\"    \\\"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed,\\\" wrote Hultman.  \\\"The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations.\\\"    Hultman reminded the commission, \\\"The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis\\\" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve.    ROA also noted \\\"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\\\"    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There \\\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\\\"          Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)\",\" Where did you read this?  I don't think this is true.

There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast).

Are you suggesting that British industry isn't making profit off the situation as well? \",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"Has someone a list of CD-ROM's with no SCSI-Interface and if known how much they are present in the market.

Agricultural slavery might # #have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no # #further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during # #the winter.  #  # This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First \\\"agricultural\\\" # slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south # slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all # of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.  And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most  valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying aspect of American slavery.  # Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to # reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's  # the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated # the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \\\"first # mechanical cotton reaper\\\" was invented.  This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_ (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted from the land.

Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person, but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond.  There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn't have all the answers.  This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?    You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.\",\"I'm using \\\"rayshade\\\" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas.

But then I remembered something.  Remember that move to get the U.S. to the metric system all those years ago?  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now.  The government sold it as better for the people, easier to be in tune with the rest of the world.  They had decided it was for our own good.  Then, when the plan was released, it soon became apparant that the government were a bunch 'o' thickies.  Think about it, change all the railroad track widths, signs, screws, abolish the old regime.  At the cost of millions of dollars.  Your point is well taken.

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to \\\"prove\\\" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:  1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so. \",\"Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally, allowing the U.S. government to spy on foreign governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens, this is a world-wide issue.

Only spooks and hard-core hackers need privacy, huh?

It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then the people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams its just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would be subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh.

I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \\\"thumbs\\\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \\\"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\\\" x 9\\\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\\\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \\\"thumbs\\\" are about  1-1/2\\\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\\\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\\\^^/   \\\\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \\\"home-made\\\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \\\"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\\\" or \\\"Mature Wisdom\\\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?\",\"I saw the following computer in a store and wanted to know if this is a good computer or does someone see something wrong with it.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\"I am looking for a 8 meg 72-pin SIMM for my Centris 610.

Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released) The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)  My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper systems.  If not we're in trouble.  Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this. They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \\\"Clipper\\\" system is easily justified \\\"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\\\" How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.  Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid. Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.  Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big, and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the hell would they jump the gun?   I really wonder.  To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:  The White House Office of the Press Secretary c/o: Presidential Comment Line (fax) (202) 456-2461   April 17, 1993   Sir and/or Madam:     I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.   It is apparent to me that those who drafted the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \\\"Big Brother Proposal\\\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep      ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \\\"experts\\\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.   In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \\\"tamper proof\\\" the key escrows might be.   I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \\\"Clipper Chip Proposal\\\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti      lize the \\\"Big Brother Chip.\\\"   Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \\\"harmony,\\\" \\\"right to encryption,\\\" and \\\"voluntary.\\\"   It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \\\"I can't believe it's happening here.\\\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \\\"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\\\"           Most Concerned,         [Signature]       Shaen Logan Bernhardt I uni@acs.bu.edu \",\"Just a shot here, but ya never know:  I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player  at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.

The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.

Do you mean by \\\"omnipotent\\\" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\". The US would simply \\\"never want to interfere\\\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.

There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.

God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.  Mike    And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"Could y'all PLEASE stop posting this stuff to tx.general.  tx.politics is sufficient and is where this stuff belongs.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).   I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title \\\"Islam and Women\\\", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \\\"I am a Muslim\\\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \\\"following the Qur'an\\\" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.\",\" -- and --   Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??

My wife has an MS Biostat, and there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work. People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well.  Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable, reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.    The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors, and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis.\",\"   While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken. Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is  unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.      From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West.   lousey spring.         Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling       bullpen.          The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the       club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting       on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to       assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually       starts the season very strong.                                   * * * * * *       On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning next year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be (blech..) traditional grey, with the word \\\"HOUSTON\\\" written across the chest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate the color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...      I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound horrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  They may not have been pretty, but Houston had established a long precident of wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and I liked it.   Astros fan since the days of Ryan, Scott, Smith, Cruz, Davis, Bass, Hatcher...\",\"Any new reports about iisi clock upgrade to 25 mhz,  33 mhz? Any failures?\",\"  \\\"Deeply rooted rivalry?\\\" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"Pens-6 NJ Devils-6  FIRST PERIOD: SCORING: 1, Pittsburgh, Daniels(Needham, Tippett)4:14. 2, NJ Devils, C.

(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.

So in sum and to beat a dead horse:  (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.  (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \\\"color sensitive\\\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.  (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are \\\"processed centrally\\\".

[DD]  Problem 1 [DD] [DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  [DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed  [DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the  [DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army.

After [Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.  Fact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in       this seventh century story!  Fact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.  Fact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there       were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and       Kurds!

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

From Ron Brown's desk, so any distortion is pro-Democrat, can you believe it?\",\" Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.  Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!  This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!  I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality defensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.\",\"  Except for the fact that it's superior in just about every way to the ISA Bus.

Maybe it will help others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is actually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.       I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail access.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more relevant than I, who have none (yet).       13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl       I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.       I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet.      They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.       No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking.      Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.      We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're really young.       40       Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.       No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.       Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.      Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \\\"what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\\\"  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.) There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with at times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment.\",\"Well, I'm back from Tokyo, so here are the standings after the April 13 update.   - Andrew  USENET Hockey Draft Standings Week 27  Posn Team    Pts Proj Cash Last Posn  1.

I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe science or questionablely legal, but this one really grabbed my attention. It was from a company name \\\"Personal Missle, Inc.\\\" or something like that.  Anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length and engines of sizes \\\"F\\\" to \\\"M\\\".  They also said that some rockets will reach 50,000 feet.  Now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one of these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes. Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.  And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.   -Paul \\\"mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite\\\" Dokas\",\" KDKA has first rights to Pirates games, and will split probably 50-50 in conflicts; for Penguins games which are preempted, check out  102.5 WDVE FM (that's right, DVE).

I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.  I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.  The problem is that my top level frame created as  frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL); seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.  I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code :  XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame;  win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);  /* So far so good */  colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);  /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */  attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);   Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?  Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.  Thanks again,   Alok.\",\"  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]   : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to \\\"how\\\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  \\\"nothing\\\", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the \\\"There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer\\\" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question \\\"why anything exists\\\" can be countered by demanding answer to a question \\\"why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence\\\". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \\\"why\\\".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \\\"how\\\", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \\\"why\\\" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the \\\"genetic code\\\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I : can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.   Petri \",\"of   A transporter operator!?!?

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time does the pressure ever become \\\"negative\\\", or even approach a good vacuum.  2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature difference and the products of combustion.  3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes, substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is _much_ louder than the stocker.  4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor. If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.  5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower. Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\"1992 Saturn SL2   5spd  23K miles  AC, cruise, ABS, Air Bag, Cassette, Anti Theft  Excellent  12,000/obo  Consider 85-88 4dr 5spd compact as part trade\",\" Who said Christians want to conform to the teachings of Jesus?\",\"The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \\\"higher truth\\\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \\\"higher\\\" or  \\\"lower\\\"; they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.  Let us not quibble; count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  \\\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\\\"  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.\",\"  As a stong self-defense advocate, you're 'statement', does littel but irk me.

But  no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday  as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow  SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.

I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.

But I agree with you that we only  have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip  was.\",\"   Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\"hi,   Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.    No flame, please.\",\" I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe). It is a 3.5\\\" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the  drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the  differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold  105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one. -Chris Wand  -- \",\"Watch from where?  Two miles away?

Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are  improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours. The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted  Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the  German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.     In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after  the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently, FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the  FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.

Based on the comments of others you might want to view the  3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate  appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

This helps get away from the small-town \\\"everybody knows everything\\\" syndrome, which some people like but I don't.  Call it several thousand people.  For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that 5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size.    It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware; they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)\",\"  ...   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the   maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the  characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility  in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font  file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters  appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')   For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows  char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font  is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac  char set.    Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209 \",\" Ya, Fat Chance.

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source.

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation.

She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies.

As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just \\\"give\\\" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [\\\"wingless Orbiter\\\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a \\\"moderate\\\" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the \\\"high cost\\\" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as \\\"one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir.

It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \\\"pusher plate\\\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.

It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century  attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans.\",\"libXaw3d, the 3D Athena widget set will greatly improve the \\\"sculptured\\\" look.

However, I don't know anyone who has one.  I have my eye on two choices.  Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.

In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment!

I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius         -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his     son:  \\\"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-     ness?\\\" \\\"I will not, father,\\\" was the  in-evitable  reply. \\\"Then     leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\\\"     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to pray:     \\\"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\\\" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. \\\"The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him.\\\" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106\",\"Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board  since 9pm.

Thanks for any tips ---> Robert rgasch@nl.oracle.com\",\"  Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"  So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

If you know the Latin, one really    beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three    deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants    in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\": [first post I've seen from the ol' Bug-Zoo (BGSU)] : >     There is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt : >that a god does not exist (but if anyone has one, by all means, tell me : >what it is).

Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.

His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.

Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult, which was what they were.  Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a  supposedly devout Muslim?

In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free.

Thanks!  Also, if you have a game boy you want to get rid of, please tell me.  \",\"Dear Mr. Davidsson,\",\"  I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:   I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for  us to say, \\\"He should hire a different coach.\\\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \\\"get that monkey off his back.\\\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how good of a GM he really is.   I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing it with you. \",\"  Nope, this won't work for a cylinder.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\"There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.

Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third, with Reboulet as the backup infielder.  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in DA in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders (heck, muffing a grounder *I* would probably have gotten to).  Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think* Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.  He looked pretty good there.  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying, he looked reasonable at first.  He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is the Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins 1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).

Note:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to pick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.\",\"Hi,  I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone  claims..)  Anyway..  1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this. Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup. Thanks!  Ryan  \",\"Tony-  While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a \\\"good thing\\\" by posting that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I have seen the film called \\\"The Gay Agenda\\\" and along with my church we found it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN \\\"EX-GAY\\\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians \\\"a way out of the homosexual death-style\\\" through prayer.  \\\"I'd like to give the award back,\\\" Caligiuri now laughs, \\\"I'm no longer deserve it.\\\"   Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national \\\"ex-gay\\\" movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \\\"There's no reality in it,\\\" he says, \\\"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\\\"   Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \\\"We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\\\" explains Bob Davies, director of Exodus.  He ventures that \\\"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.\\\"   \\\"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time,\\\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \\\"redeemed lesbian\\\" who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \\\"These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\\\"   \\\"It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,\\\" says sex educator Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \\\"But it's really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay, but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\\\"   Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.  \\\"I was really drunk,\\\" he recalls, \\\"and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night, and the next morning he raped me again.\\\"   When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.  \\\"He had another man there with him,\\\" Caligiuri recalls.  \\\"I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is about, I don't want to be this way anymore.\\\"   Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance, Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \\\"We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\\\" Caligiuri says, \\\"so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.\\\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says, adding, \\\"They'll do anything to reach these people.\\\"   \\\"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\\\" recalls Peter Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, \\\"like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\\\"   Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  \\\"They were relieved,\\\" he recalls. \\\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.\\\"   But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \\\"By the time I appeared on Sally's show,\\\" \\\"I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.\\\"   Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \\\"used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.\\\"  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping with other \\\"reformed\\\" homosexuals.   \\\"I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another,\\\" Caligiuri says.  \\\"We'd go to conferences in other cities, and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.\\\"   By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988, Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's host asked him if he ever \\\"acted on temptation,\\\" his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \\\"I was too sick to go to church,\\\" he explains.  \\\"The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\\\"   Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors.  \\\"I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people,\\\" he says.   Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\\\"I'm interest- ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.\\\"), considering romance (\\\"But not with a CHristian!\\\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to. \\\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\\\" he says.  \\\"I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.\\\"  ---end article---  Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some, like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \\\"Lazarus Project\\\" of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \\\"Love In Action\\\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \\\"reformed\\\" or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \\\"sealing\\\" their new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \\\"sin\\\" through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's _\\\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.\",\" If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise is probably coming from there and not from the fan.

The focus of their intent is his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (\\\"forty days and forty nights\\\", \\\"pair of every animal\\\", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \\\"A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage\\\".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly.  In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto, admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the  consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.\",\"This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\" Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?  I think there must be some confusion here.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:   Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,  but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal  of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of  all things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, \\\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\\\"  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------       NINETEENTH LETTER       MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'    In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. \",\"# #The official and legal term for rape is \\\"the crime of forcing a FEMALE  # #to submit to sexual intercourse.\\\" #  # Please, supply me with some references.

One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwards were all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?    OK, \\\"this ain't North America\\\" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city having a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course, Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small distances between cities but still.    Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one of the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about 7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built unless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena.    Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has  5,000 seats I think.   If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work. Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for major league hockey.   ...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa to hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but showed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan and the smaller cities in the north.   Paris had their own \\\"Volans Francais\\\"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago. I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals  tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for  attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor  sport like hockey.   The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.   Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning anyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by  enthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy marketing, fans that have difficulty telling what \\\"icing\\\" means... London has been mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new mega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.   No facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500  fans for hockey. \",\"Dear friends,  I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee.

You'll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.     One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.

A.Lizard \",\"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6  [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\"Facts: ===== - A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered down for three months. - From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive. - Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a - When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed \\\"successfully\\\", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

I hear the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three, WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the catergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the theme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP is totally original.  Their hosts actually have a personality (this is a knock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and Sommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia to the ones in Washington is a total joke.

I know it is very contrary to the American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence. For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night. To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the test.  And who are we to test God?

I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.       What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.        From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.        The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.        Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to  actually take place?

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of  commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start  of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I'll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.     And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and  interesting -- Any and all comments are welcome.  \",\" In soc.religion.christian you write:   Note that the above type of prediction does not require a God to be made. An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like \\\"The volcano will erupt tomorrow!\\\"  Don't follow the preacher because of such statements that come true.  Note also, that if I'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say \\\"his mother predicted he would die.\\\"  Of course, his father may have said \\\"he 'll make good money because of his hobby\\\" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \\\"Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\\\" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has come.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if you can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.  Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.  -leo \",\" The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements, since the \\\"is\\\" in those statements is the \\\"is\\\" of predication rather than of identity.  Instead, they should be translated using a predicate letter.  Using \\\"g\\\" to designate God and \\\"j\\\" to designate Jesus, and the predicate letter \\\"E\\\" for the property of being eternal, the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.     The second premise appears to contain an \\\"is\\\" of identity, in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that \\\"Jesus is a subset of God\\\" suggests that strict identity is not desired here.

You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from  Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4\\\". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30. You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear. The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines. \",\"Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights. Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount of hockey interest exists in the city.

Any information would be appreciated.  \",\" Dear Tim:  You say that you were a \\\"catholic,\\\" but if you do not believe in the Christian God (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,    you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  \\\"Public heretics, even those who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body of the Church\\\" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).  All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,    n. 16) teaches: \\\"Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\\\"    Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God.    Stick with the best. --  boundary, the catechist \",\"      And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian troops controlling the country.  Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.    I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syria having no right to be in Lebanon?     The UN also thought Zionism is racism.  That fails to make it true.    They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.   They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are usually picked up in the morning.     Nonsense.  Israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the negotiating table for 40 years.  It was the gulf war that brought the arabs to the table, not the Israelis.     Nonsense.

INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:   send SPACE Index  send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \\\"VIEWING IMAGES\\\" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL string and receive the results.  Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other  products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase, RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.  For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. It works with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.  However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising. It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the \\\"ODBC Programmer's Reference\\\" and the \\\"ODBC SDK Guide\\\". Moreover, ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also, it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK).  Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future.  Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by  a line of asterisks (*).   ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want.  The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox 4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think turbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).  Now.. reading the box... it's \\\"Borland Paradox Engine & Database Frameworks\\\".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later, Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or later.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0. It does have support for object useage...  I haven't had a real chance to really use it myself... but it looks fairly complete... I'm planning to use it this summer. -Rick --  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+  ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product which is called Paradox Engine.

Its hardly SQL though.

I'm currently using it (I have an eval copy..) and I've linked it in to some entry screens I've written.  The Engine library adds about 100K to the size of the program, but you can load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM manager.  Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support but they don't really expect it till late in the year... or even next year They are trying to get thrid parties to help out..  If you have any other questions -- let me know...  Mike Kamlet mike@vpnet.chi.il.us   ****************************************************************************  Yes, borland sells their Paradox Engine separately.  It has C, C++, and Pascal interfaces, although the underlying interface is in 'C'. Well at least for version 2.0 of the Engine which I have (costed $99 at Egghead).

There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of the names offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard - (I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the \\\"C Users Journal\\\", which is a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way). I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over the past year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'm staying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much time invested in learning and work-arounds!  But if your interest is limited to a simple single-user interface (you want to build your own SQL engine, I take it), PX Engine will do the job easily - it doesn't sound like you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\" And in other parts of the world, European \\\"Socialists\\\" would be known as fascist capitalist pigs.

Only # very stupid people (such as yourself) confuse a discussion of mental health # related to \\\"Jane Doe\\\", who was in a mental institution, and attempt to claim # that this same argument could be applied to a woman who decided she wanted # an abortion because she was having a \\\"bad hair day\\\". #  # As you well know, the facts are that there are about 100 third-trimester # abortions performed in this country annually, and those are *only* done for # *serious* health reasons. # -- # Larry Margolis, MARGOLI@YKTVMV (Bitnet), margoli@watson.IBM.com (Internet)  Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it.\",\"  My blood pressure soars, my heart pounds, and I can't get to sleep for the life of me... feels about like I just drank 8 cups of coffee.

It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians          'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]  At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War.  In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'   \\\"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall   see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations  and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to  the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are  strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.  On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is  bereft of social sanctities.\\\"[2]  [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press    1934), Preface.

Serdar Argic\",\" That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\" Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"Years ago I grabbed the following from the net - maybe from this newsgroup.

It  ->makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar,  ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he  ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity,  ->in the process he became a Christian himself.  Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he  belong to? Does it have a name?  -> The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a  ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.  Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been that he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not  impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.  -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.

I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try?  Thanks for any advice. \",\"    A good point.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.

Thanks!\",\"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.     Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter?  One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of  his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric.   This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \\\"race\\\" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be  emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to  govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a \\\"strong\\\" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness.  It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide.   The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.  No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon  election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A  rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.  It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a  task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security.  Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to  control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot  affect the system. \",\"  Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around?

Some guy in a NAMBLA T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down, he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.  Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual orientation, you have no business saying so.   Despite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards?   Ah.  So, for example, you are opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964?   There's no \\\"for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will be defined as\\\" section?  No definitions anywhere?

I am going, but only to watch.  \",\"  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.

I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.\",\"As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your messages until April 18.

But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations. There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn.   1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.   2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.   3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a  torque which twists the bike over.  Take an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5, 15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each effect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at high speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all, relatively speaking.  By the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running group where we could start \\\"counter-footing\\\" arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\",\"stuff deleted stuff deleted  The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the 700 and 900).

Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he DNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion I don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this.   Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical that some may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if these toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross the intestinal mucosa?  Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost *anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ.\",\"Hi, I'm looking for the 3-D studio driver for the  Oak card with 1 M of RAM.

Thanks in advance\",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\"   Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way through a corner??   Agreed!

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In practice I suspect most people do what you describe.   If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've achieved maximum braking or not.

Among others, see Olney's  \\\"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety\\\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.   Whose talking about \\\"food science\\\"? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)   Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   They're unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to \\\"sacrifice\\\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches? I don't know. \",\"------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------  You've heard about Apple's great new customer \\\"support\\\" program.  Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it. Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                    United States      1-800-776-2333                   Canada             800-665-2775                   UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                   Australia          61-2-452-8000                   Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500  If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.

Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.\",\"  Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic cult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)  For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:  The Covenant of the Flame by David Morrell.  It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing. I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it is relevant to Mithraism.\",\"  The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\"xSorry to repost this again so soon, but xthe information from my earlier post was xdeleted from our system. xI am looking for information concerning x\\\"sprayed-on\\\" bedliners for pickup trucks. xA company here does it using polyurethene xbut they've only been around for 9 months xso there's not much of a track record here. xIs the sprayed-on bedliner any good?

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.  Steve\",\"Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.  First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a \\\"lock-up\\\" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\",\" So?  Look in the trunk some time.  Heck - look at the dash.

The only time this difference can matter is if neither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around like that.  BTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to know about the second, third, and so on.   How do \\\"we\\\" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops or even law-abiding menacing minorities.

Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some \\\"key\\\" item that can get lost.    So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.

To do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and subsequent development and urbanization of these former private hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.\",\"  According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it.

You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able to create, however. :-)\",\" This is a good point, but I think \\\"average\\\" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn't hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like \\\"...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace.\\\" or something like that.  (Of course, I suppose, if someone were REALLY \\\"at peace\\\", there would be no need for inflicting evangelism)   Well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  Argumentation does not really seem to apply to Christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a step the person takes naturally, almost, \\\"instinctively\\\"...   best regards,  ******************************************************************************** * Adam John Cooper  \\\"Verily, often have I laughed at the weaklings * *       who thought themselves good simply because  * * acooper@macalstr.edu    they had no claws.\\\"        * ********************************************************************************\",\"    \",\" Yeah, but what's your point?

I'm not sure, but I think I found another legal source of cheap hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges. More on that when my mail order succeeds. --  Jeffrey Jonas\",\"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\"Excerpts from netnews.alt.atheism: 15-Apr-93 Re: thoughts on christians by Dave Fuller@portal.hq.vi  I think it'd help if we got a couple good atheists (or even some good, steadfast agnostics) in some high political offices.  When was the last time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some Supreme court justices?    One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news program on a local station...The promo said something like \\\"Who are these cults, and why do they prey on the young?\\\"  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what is...  I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually, I guess he wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for (indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect it...    I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people.  Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.  Religion in general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.    Blech.

If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago.  But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone who says, \\\"Lord, I want you to do this for me, but don't expect me to change my way of life,\\\" that is a different matter. Even here, I would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good).

Pete deuelpm@craft.camp.clarkson.edu \",\" No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects, however, generally don't get \\\"funding\\\" -- they get \\\"customers\\\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.  Nahh.  He's too busy watching for mutant bacteria to notice anything in the sky :-)   Jordin Kare jtk@s1.gov Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\",\" And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of  better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want  one is to evade the police.\\\"  They don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)  Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen them advertised in the trade press.  Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start looking at the data too...  Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private crypto stand out like a sore thumb.\",\" True enough.

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood  transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are  Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood  transfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood  transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as  Christians could be perceived to be arrogant.  The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary  to save the life of the child is irrelevant here.

I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???  It didn't \\\"splinter\\\" from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  #>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

I am not comfortable with this alleged \\\"cosiness\\\" with Mammon: I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about suicide and \\\"atone for sins with blood\\\") is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...  # #        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS #and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts #from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \\\"orders\\\" (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX \\\"Peace Keeper\\\" missile maze in Utah).  #        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have #splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small #and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry. # #        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"bm967@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (David Kantrowitz) writes ...

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache?  I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses?

Ken \",\" Gawd, I love Windows :-)   You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"  But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at 200 MHz.

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (\\\"orange\\\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \\\"identified\\\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \\\"U\\\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \\\"hot\\\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \\\"hots\\\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \\\"romex\\\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    \\\"Greenfield\\\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  \\\"Wiremold\\\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \\\"feed\\\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \\\"hot\\\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \\\"bond\\\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham to set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before drawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part, but Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: \\\"tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And coming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.\\\"  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the damned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27), although it saw Him (cf.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!

A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime.  And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.  On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we  didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home  watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our  house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the  direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off  the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.  Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.  We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down  with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \\\"What's going on? What's  happened?\\\" They say, \\\"Armenians, get out of here!\\\" We don't open the door, we  say, \\\"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\\\" They say, \\\"No,  leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\\\" By now they've  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.  We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We  held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an  axe, and then with a crowbar.  When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them  with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,  pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father  in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured  several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But  they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them.  The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go  into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of  about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no  one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \\\"What's with you,  woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\\\" She says, \\\"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\\\" My father  was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian  and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,  \\\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he  brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\\\" He says, \\\"You  don't need to shout, stop shouting.\\\" And when they heard the voice of this  man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,  too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't  know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night.  Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were  from Khachmas. They said, \\\"We heard that a group was here at your place, you  have our condolences.\\\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room.  So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around  one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,  investigators. They say, \\\"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\\\" Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take  Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take  Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor's.  The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles, ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a  landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking  into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians  weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they  poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \\\"They're up there, still, up there. Let's go kill them!\\\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding  one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling  the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,  and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \\\"No, that's from some of the  furniture.\\\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed  him down.  The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians, they had left for another city.  The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \\\"Are you  crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the  apartments? They could kill you and them!\\\" And to us :\\\" . . . Come on, leave  this apartment!\\\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went  downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the  other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.  They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.  With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely  accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We  were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the  troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been  even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide.  Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock  in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were  about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It  was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people  there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It  was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a  man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces  were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...  Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my  father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.  I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.  I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They  weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The  inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They  weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were  at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us.  As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus  station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. You can tell that the \\\"operation\\\" was  planned in advance.  Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops  suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.  At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could  happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds.  Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass  disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There  were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all.  They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

Keep trying.  \",\"  But why do you characterize this as a \\\"flight of fancy\\\" or a \\\"fantasy\\\"? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy.   Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, \\\"extra-scientific\\\", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a \\\"surprising\\\" experiment is, what counts as \\\"surprising\\\", etc. The same may be said about \\\"logical grounds\\\".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \\\"sea of air\\\" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \\\"surprising\\\"? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of \\\"perfectly rational grounds\\\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \\\"new\\\"?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like.\",\"He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. \",\"Hey now.

No, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login process.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the \\\"passenger car division\\\" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)\",\" But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will NEVER lead anywhere.  I'm sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials.    Good point.  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to \\\"circle the wagons\\\" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless (maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects, such as the \\\"yeast hypothesis\\\").  But evidence is evidence - it requires a \\\"jury\\\" or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not worthless.

I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of \\\"cosmic essence.\\\" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery.

Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1118\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1117\"}},\"id\":\"1067\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1047\",\"type\":\"BasicTicker\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1109\",\"type\":\"AllLabels\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1043\",\"type\":\"BasicTicker\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1111\",\"type\":\"BasicTickFormatter\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1118\",\"type\":\"Selection\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"fill_alpha\":0.5,\"fill_color\":\"lightgrey\",\"group\":null,\"level\":\"overlay\",\"line_alpha\":1.0,\"line_color\":\"black\",\"line_dash\":[4,4],\"line_width\":2,\"syncable\":false,\"xs_units\":\"screen\",\"ys_units\":\"screen\"},\"id\":\"1056\",\"type\":\"PolyAnnotation\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"data_source\":{\"id\":\"1068\"},\"glyph\":{\"id\":\"1097\"},\"group\":null,\"hover_glyph\":null,\"muted_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1099\"},\"name\":\"raw\",\"nonselection_glyph\":{\"id\":\"1098\"},\"view\":{\"id\":\"1101\"}},\"id\":\"1100\",\"type\":\"GlyphRenderer\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1116\",\"type\":\"Selection\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1093\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1112\",\"type\":\"AllLabels\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1117\",\"type\":\"UnionRenderers\"},{\"attributes\":{\"tools\":[{\"id\":\"1050\"},{\"id\":\"1051\"},{\"id\":\"1052\"},{\"id\":\"1053\"},{\"id\":\"1054\"},{\"id\":\"1055\"}]},\"id\":\"1058\",\"type\":\"Toolbar\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1034\",\"type\":\"DataRange1d\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.2},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1099\",\"type\":\"Circle\"}],\"root_ids\":[\"1105\"]},\"title\":\"Bokeh Application\",\"version\":\"2.4.3\"}};\n",
