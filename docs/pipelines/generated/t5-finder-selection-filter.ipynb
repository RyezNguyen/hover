They represent a personal collection, not anything resembling an officially supported set.  As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts: 1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can    stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability    to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking    in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play    around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable    about what you're doing. 4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files    you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.

When I originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.  Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given the \\\"no disk to boot from\\\" icon.  However, upon turing the computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.   Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot  button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power off and on always works.  This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.  Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed?  I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to  \\\"come up to speed\\\" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before  trying to access the HD?

EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.          As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control.          Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them?\",\"I have two books, both NASA Special Publications, on the Voyager  Missions.

Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.

Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\" I'm an new to this.

I have several ideas, but I'd prefer to benefit from all you brilliant people :-)\",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"$400included shipping  \",\"Th following cd's are for sale.

I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper \",\" Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed, right?   \\\"There are always going to be questions until there's a product  out there,\\\" Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first  encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated  Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.    - Scientific American, March 1990, page 77\",\" BUT...

The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church \\\"Holy Mother Church\\\" and our \\\"Mother.\\\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, \\\"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?\\\"  Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that \\\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many.\\\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \\\"From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\\\"  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \\\"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\\\" (1 Corinthians 11.26)   You are quite right about the identification of \\\"Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots\\\" with Rome.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

BUT government  should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible  for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them. I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make  money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions.

Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.

Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

In splicing them    together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent   him in any way.  I don't *think* I've done so. ]   Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think) to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the time.   Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.  Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're protected from doing what you want with your life.  Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:  Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car. If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell that car.  Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone thinks that it's \\\"wrong\\\" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or their money, it is your life and your money.  My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car. Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.  That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression. And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.  This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty. And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.\",\"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES  By David Ljunggren  MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.  Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring.  The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending  planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.  It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions,\\\" the journalists quoted Duliyan as  saying.  \\\"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft units.\\\"  Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.  The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.  A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.  Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.  \\\"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,\\\" he said.  Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops  involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.  Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.  \\\"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,\\\" the agency said.  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders.  \\\"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population,\\\" Tass quoted him as saying.       At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed.  \\\"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,\\\" he said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not  been recognised by any other country.  Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.  Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia, had resigned.  Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office. Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official confirmation.  \",\"------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anonymous,  I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins). It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the components as well as their values.  In other words I want to produce quality drawings.  Printout would be to either 24 pin dot-matrix and/or Laser Printer.  If you know of such a CAD program that is of reasonable cost, please respond.  Fred W. Culpepper OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY (Retired) fculpepp@norfolk.vak12ed.edu\",\"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

It is an S3 86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say \\\"Buy the memory from us\\\" or something like that.)   The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was \\\"Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\\\"   So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.   If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \\\"less busy\\\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint.

Remember the default colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.  Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.  (if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on MB1).\",\" That's open for debate.

I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.

Box 23089  L'enfant Plaza Station  Washington DC 20024\",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.

The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.     2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.     3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.     4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.     5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.     6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.     The Greeks killed also many Jews.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\"  Awww, right, you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and shot eh?

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.    For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.  - - ---------------------------------   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE     Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government      agencies to listen in on phone conversations?  A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a  little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn.  Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the  points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert, but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know  which direction the polygon should be visible from.  If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...

The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.  Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.

That leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the right wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA which just elected a socialist government :-)   Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only  untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.    Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.  And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you. We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social  democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism.  The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.    Ed starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.   Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The  magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and  corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just as baddly.  What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people who are free of any hint of corruption.

But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \\\"to worship in their own way\\\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.\\\"[1]  \\\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions.

On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes.

When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite  U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for a new lock for the bicycle.  For about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock (advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both, Kryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel). I chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in disgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.  First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by the Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of quality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable lock with the Kryptonite name on it.  Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I don't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often quite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes it would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.  Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves the sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the  dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the  lock mechanism would stand up to an \\\"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\\\" attack.

I'll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them, though your usage is quite valid.   I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or  describes things we can observe.  Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_, basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a  clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.  I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not  the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered  fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle  systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original  point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only  the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being  any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.  The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:     1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational         evidence (your way)     2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it         a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence   and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can         be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't  much to say.  Do you agree? \",\" Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?    shorter or longer ?     First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do the trick.  Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any.  Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

Even if a pro-gun person doesn't know what they are talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or two.  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I have to say.  I have several good sources of material now that I know where to look so calm down.  Ah, Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have also asked several of the not-so-hostile folks on this group for sources of information to read.  Do you think, Freeman, that maybe this means I am interested in learning?  I think it does because as you said people who don't know anything won't be good for the pro-gun cause.  Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman and accept mistakes.  Sure, maybe it could have been some type of misinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  I made my statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry about it but also to learn as much as you can.

One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.    - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony   without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married   in God's eyes.

The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach.\",\"NHL RESULTS FOR GAMES PLAYED 4/15/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   STANDINGS       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE  TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   xPIT  56 21  7 119  xBOS  51 26  7 109  xCHI  47 25 12 106  xVAN  46 29  9 101 yWAS  42 34  7  91  yQUE  47 27 10 104  yDET  47 28  9 103  yCAL  43 30 11  97 yNJ   40 36  7  87  yMON  48 30  6 102  yTOR  44 29 11  99  yLA   39 35 10  88 yNYI  39 37  7  85  yBUF  38 36 10  86  ySTL  37 36 11  85  yWIN  40 37  7  87  PHL  35 37 11  81   HAR  26 51  6  58   MIN  36 38 10  82   EDM  26 50  8  60  NYR  34 38 11  79   OTT  10 70  4  24   TB   23 54  7  53   SJ   11 71  2  24  x -

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc., it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.   These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and \\\"send\\\" or \\\"put\\\" your files.  Note that you won't be able to  see the files with the \\\"ls\\\" or \\\"dir\\\" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

Yeah, they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost 16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.  Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure.  If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere $2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)   According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife.

No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)  I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

This wanton murder of a four-month-old baby, which shocked foreign    observers as much as the Turkish Community, was not committed by    irresponsible persons, but by members of the Greek Cypriot security    forces.

Thanks in advance.\",\"     One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.\",\"I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.

Is there anything in the works to install \\\"scrubbers\\\" for diesels?  How about the feasibility of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any different than a catylitic converter?

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.  \",\"   This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without clipper?

This includes NASA, the shuttles, history, anything!  I would like to know if anyone could suggest books, periodicals, even ftp sites for a novice who is interested in the space program.  \",\"Disclaimer -- This is for fun.  In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called \\\"stolen hits\\\", defined as a play made that \\\"an average fielder would not make with average effort.\\\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \\\"Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.\\\"  OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.  I'm considering two basic options:  1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs     due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.     That may be pushing my limit.

Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

The whole organization (read: EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly  humiliating him, stripping him of the \\\"C\\\", and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.  The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.  [Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the roster but he DID lay a foundation.]\",\" It's exactly as dangerous as it looks. You're hard to see and have little protection.

The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks...\",\"After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good.  How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.\",\"              ...   Why do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the same number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind Chicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?

I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on \\\"regional issues\\\".  The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated.

Unline Win3.1, it does not  run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.  With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob\",\" Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).  There is time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless. \",\"It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business  or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.  When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions,  explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. (I promise I am not making this up!)  I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any  headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed  laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets.  \",\"Koc) responded to article <1993Apr22.152937.14766@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.  [DD]  Problem 1 [DD] [DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  [DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed  [DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the  [DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army.  [DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the  [DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army.  [DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to  [DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers  [DD] there were before the massacre.  [Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760  Good for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri  soldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate the area of Armenians!  [Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After [Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.  Fact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in       this seventh century story!  Fact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.  Fact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there       were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and       Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon        either!  Conclusion: Numbers don't lie in either case!   \",\"   Possibly because gay/bi men are less likely to get married?

There are two precision levels, one   for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil   ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),   though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with   an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the   same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated   then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),   You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of   Your original signals.

Therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become  common.  The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.  For example,  Story of Adam and Eve: Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide  in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden. (There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God.)  Traditional Philosophy: 1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades. 2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler  and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without  question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.  Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy: They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their \\\"Father\\\" said to.  Being forced to leave the  Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.  Lessons from Traditional Interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \\\"welfare\\\") is ideal.  Get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment. 3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad. 4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and  should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for  themselves. 5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.  1990's philosophy: 1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless named \\\"Hillary Clinton\\\" or \\\"Murphy Brown\\\". 2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people  (binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.  Interpretation of events based on current philosophy: They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were  REWARDED by being allowed into the \\\"real world.\\\"  Lessons from new interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \\\"welfare\\\") is at best a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good. 4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \\\"alter or abolish\\\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves. 5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children  without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves).  I have tentatively named this new philosophy \\\"The Church of Eveism\\\" because Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek  knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it  until it was actively sought.  ---End serious discussion.

The author is not responsible for any          damage caused by this program.   Important changes since version 1.30:     Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).     Improve file management system (more user-friendly).     Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.     Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.     Fix bug in GEM/IMG reading.     Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.     Auto-skip macbinary header.   (1) Introduction:   This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different   formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)   on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different   formts.   Include simple file management system.   Support 'slide show'.   There is NO LIMIT on image size.   Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.   If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.   If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).   (2) Hardware Requirement:   PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.   min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).   (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).   Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).    The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.    Supported Wares:    * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)   * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping   * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768   * 80387   * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies   * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX    Unsupported:    * DPMI   * Microsoft Windows    Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory   model, SVGA graphics.

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\" cjackson> I am very glad to know that none of you judgemental little shits has cjackson> ridden/driven when too tired, sleepy, hungover, angry, or distracted cjackson> in the last 3 years.

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates.

If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  'sad mac' sound.

Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now.

Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bring this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal  became a lemon?  As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insisted that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it is bad. Is this reasonable?  Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of  the thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.  I would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my e-mail address.  I know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make it enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?\",\"    When I got my knee rebuilt I got back on the street bike ASAP.

Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \\\"accepted uncritically,\\\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \\\"knows\\\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \\\"knows\\\" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of \\\"God\\\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \\\"god\\\". In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \\\"God\\\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity.\",\"    You have done no such thing.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second). The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation.  To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices.  A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation, and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed.  I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones (the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?\",\"Hi,    I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs for the sound blaster.

I of course don't know the exact situation, and anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?    Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it.    This info is taken mostly from a few \\\"experts\\\", my own experience, and some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any specifics handy).\",\"Here's the updated list of the stuff I still have for sale.

Any reason given for this?  Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout. On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.\",\" Let me ask you this.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\"The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read on...

I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.

I  am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about  1000-10,000.  Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part  number, or when they do look around for something in their line  they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.

That is because your premises are wrong from the word \\\"Go\\\".  You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.  Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs \\\"regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary.\\\"  Without any evidence to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem  argument.  Mind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion.

Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)   I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form \\\"the man you live with is not your husband\\\" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all, that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes  through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex  canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another,  or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility  for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that  God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source  for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.        Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness.  You might have said \\\"burp\\\", for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \\\"taking the Lord's  name in vain\\\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of  hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.   If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for example, God's code could include, \\\"Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on\\\", but this law would be inapplicable to us. Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God.   But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to follow?

That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing? I hope I helped somewhat.\",\"Bully, Them; Bludgeon Them, Bury Them. --  Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>\",\"From article <1qvgu5INN2np@lynx.unm.edu>, by osinski@chtm.eece.unm.edu (Marek Osinski):   Thessaloniki is called Thessaloniki by its inhabitants for the last 2300 years.

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \\\"homer\\\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at? My wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan and a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together for just a few bucks.

As a  left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto dealers.    But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms, to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws, and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a  particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special interests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly designed to accomplish the opposite.  jsh\",\": In article <C4u3x5.Fw7@magpie.linknet.com> manes@magpie.linknet.com (Steve   : [...] : > I don't know how anyone can state that gun control could have NO : > effect on homicide rates.

I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite for not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m.  [dictionary definitions of \\\"not\\\" \\\"disagree\\\" and \\\"agree\\\" deleted]  Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of  red herrings and smoke screens.  Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont was kind enough to send me):   Taking action? A white geese be held  as an accomplice to be held as  a decision upon the door  A black and white goose waddles past  the eyes of the door.   Hits it with the confidence interval for   that individual is held responsible   for that, that individual   may be held as a   getaway car may be held   as an uncountably large number   of the driver of something   and agree.   A black goose   waddles past the person imprisoned?   White goose waddles past the   confidence interval for the population   of geese be axed,   fine.  And white goose   waddles past the door.  Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more coherent?  Less coherent?  Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the \\\"getaway car\\\" tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our being is not to \\\"get away\\\" from responsibility for our actions, but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the \\\"driver\\\" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?  Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and a random number generator?\",\"To get hierarchical icon groups in MS-Windows use Norton Desktop for Windows.  MS Windows in not mature.

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).  White trash: \\\"White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the  word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only  with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.\\\"  -- my father.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.

Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):  Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.  (Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it. Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)  Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.  (Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain...)  Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that \\\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\\\"  Blackmail?      (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....     \\\"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to     do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose     disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under     extortion statutes.\\\")  How do you define as \\\"blackmail\\\" one party's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.  You go on to say: \\\"The plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement, because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\\\"  If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well, shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did.)  And then you say: \\\"Everyone's property rights were protected; the plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\\\" As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \\\"made whole.\\\" They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that \\\"unnecessary\\\" settlement costs are avoided? (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)   (1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \\\"infamous,\\\" at least not at my school.  (Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_ educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)  I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call \\\"economic correctness\\\" over justice.  (2) It is \\\"completely sensible\\\" only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts. (And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take other people's property by eminent domain.)   Really?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_?   I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as \\\"law and economics\\\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many \\\"tie-breaker\\\" factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by the scale of \\\"justice\\\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by _Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.\",\" How is it ever going to be an Off- the Shelf Technology if someone doesn't do it?

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"Here's what I (think) have figured out.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication Date: Jun. 1986       As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere  troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar  features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large  VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  and results are discussed. \",\"   With relays alone, you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch, THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.   It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices are cheaper than relays.\",\"   I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than most that are flamed about here: I (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and my girlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of at least twenty-five Harley riders.

Before you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club. Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?  Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.   Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US  is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.  Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.  Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But  they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't  fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence  to those with political connections.  Is this fair?   And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets? How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?   Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry. Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed  carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good, then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing. Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for  these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.   (\\\"Hot-livered.\\\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \\\"hot-headed.\\\")   Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just \\\"pre-felons\\\" waiting to commit crimes.   I don't understand this sentence.   Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car. But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one.   None of ours, I'm sure.   Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone, either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who  drive drunk, drive without it!  However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life. I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.   The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do. I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun. I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning one, too. -- \",\"You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.

I can't figure out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to the U.S.  Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows]. What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis for comparison.

On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY...

If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslin's.\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \\\"heavy\\\" for the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... \\\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.   DB... \\\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^   MY REPLY...

Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that's the first criteria we must examine.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?

Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\"  I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too.

Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.  As the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are not long without an NHL team.  It just seems \\\"right\\\" that the hotbed of amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the 1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).  I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"   Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a  bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was  NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \\\"slip\\\" device in the shaft to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!    On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane do a \\\"stoppy\\\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike  up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these activities anymore (now that I'm an \\\"old guy\\\" with kids of my own) but it looked damn impressive!!    If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed in that direction! :-)\",\"   This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today if one is willing to spend enough.  Thus the concern is not economic.  The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.  As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent that except via Clipper, but \\\"cheap, secure crypto for everyone\\\" is a political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is  to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate communications and tapping the crooks. \",\"   For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals                                            505-530-6563    For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico                                       508-277-6563                                    ftp from                               ptrg.eece.unm.edu      Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password                cd /pub/khoros/release     That will get you to the right place.\",\" To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human, but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\" Would if only it were true ...

I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.

I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were \\\"meant,\\\" but just didn't make it in there.              The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule. I only believe that the rule is a good idea.

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?

It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic.  As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither \\\"white\\\" nor \\\"black,\\\" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on.  Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because \\\"Ethiopia\\\" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)

Dec. 1989  Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London, last week.  The diaspora, he claimed, \\\"was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people\\\". He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust.  He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \\\"the failure of Judaism\\\".  His talk, entitled \\\"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\\\", covered 5,000 years of Jewish history.  Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he said \\\"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\\\", and all Jews outside Israel \\\"who were using other people's countries like hotels\\\".  The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere.  Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.  Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \\\"a soldier for aliyah\\\", ended by calling for the creation of a new \\\"total Jew\\\", living in Israel.  Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature, Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country's political situation.  He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada.  Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity, emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.  Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real \\\"flesh and blood character\\\".  He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.  Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said.  He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language. \",\"Is there aything available for X similar to QuicKeys for the Macintosh -- something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes, menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another application?

The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.

The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.

Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.

What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?   3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a \\\"business computer\\\" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  \",\"Hi Netters  I want to know if 13500 (w/o tax) is a good deal for 1993 Mazda 626 DX How is the performance review so far on Mazda 626.

I will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and  then address Kermit's offering.  John Redelfs originally wrote...    jr> I learned that a man cannot frustrate justice by repenting on his   jr> death bed because repentance is more than a feeling of remorse.  It   jr> requires faith in Christ proven by following him, by keeping his   jr> commandments.  Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed.

I responded to John that...    rw>    I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.   rw>   rw>    Rather, I see implied the fact that only those who are saved   rw> may enter paradise.  To which Kermit wrote...  kt> Incomplete reference: kt> kt> See also the discussion: Did Jesus go into Hell in the BibleStudy group kt> for the arguments that Paradise and Hell(sheol) are places after death kt> The discussion (no LDS were involved as far as I could see) argued using kt> standard Christian argument from the Bible that pretty much support the kt> LDS position. kt> kt>    Christ went to paridise after his death and burial. kt> kt>    He taught the prisoners and freed them from Darkness. kt> kt>    When he was resurrected, he had not yet ascended to his father. kt> kt> The arguement centered around what was or wasn't the proper biblical kt> terms for those places.       I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong, even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along. She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power.  The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000 line and the Mercedes would be helpful.  Price is not an impediment.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy J.

No one suggests that :such analysis should be left to \\\"regulators.\\\"  In fact, the \\\"re-inventing :government\\\" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the :analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more :about it.     Okay,  let me try to explain this.  When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President, one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted. I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations, the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation, combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations.      :Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only \\\"feasible\\\" approach.  What is :not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  :licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent :tasks.  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"feasible\\\" in this case.  Do you mean that [] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in fact?   :Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  :generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.  2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.  :(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to :be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending :that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt  with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.  :Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries :frequently generate support by acting as protectors of \\\"geezers,\\\"  :mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds :that \\\"we don't have much to fear\\\" from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.

In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly: The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered \\\"defense\\\" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.

Please email to info@sgcs.com for more details.  - Thomas --\",\"We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \\\"I18N.h\\\"  extern \\\"C\\\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.  In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.  Thank you. \",\"  I think I can.

Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.

The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

(BTW - they didn't honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense and the benefits, but they're wrong.  This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it doesn't measure the benefits either.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I guess that's why they're so successful there.\\\"  Indeed, it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Somewhere, perhaps a privacy group, they discussed the legal ramifications of using a password like    I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden  a while back.  The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has no bearing on the veracity of that phrase.  You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself (e.g., \\\"where did you bury the body?\\\"); you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant.  Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker.

Please point out where I have said I even _was_ a member of that group, much less asked to be treated as such, much less insisted upon it.   Wait a minute.  You've been claiming for quite a while now that pedophilia, according to CA state law, is a sexual orientation.  Now your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?  You know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down, he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.  Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual orientation, you have no business saying so.   Despite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards?   Ah.  So, for example, you are opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964?   There's no \\\"for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will be defined as\\\" section?  No definitions anywhere?

Mark Novakovic\",\"Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!   BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

That he did this was a good thing...it is better he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would truly jeopardize the franchise.  Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will sell to someone who will probably get enough.  There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...  ...one has to remember \\\"Peter Puck's principle\\\"...it is better to spend other people's money than one's own if at all possible.\",\"    That last was me, Steve Novak.

Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP. ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.  One more division to go.... --  Dale J.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.  Thanks \",\" Peanut butter was definitely my favorite. I don't think I ever took a second bite of the strawberry.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\" (Neil Williams) writes...  #  #As long as we're on the subject...

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\"  CNN just claimed he bought 104 \\\"semi-automatic assault rifles\\\".  And they say Koresh wasn't god-like...  He managed to buy or build a collection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles...  Quite a feat, I would say.  ;-)  They're still making charges of \\\"sexual abuse\\\" and such, or course. Nobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing to do with sex crimes.  Or maybe the feds have recently instituted a TAX on sex crimes...  Yeah, that's why the BATF was there, looking for unregistered *guns* (\\\"this is my weapon, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for...\\\").   I also heard that they're claiming to be cautious because of Koresh's \\\"heated ammunition stockpile\\\".  I seem to recall that smokeless powder tends to decompose at even moderate temperatures.  I would be rather surprised, after a fire of that nature, if *any* of his \\\"stockpile\\\" is unexploded, or unburned.   I seem to recall that aluminum powder is a common component of fireworks...  The folks on rec.pyro could probably tell you.   I think *anything* is legal if you have the proper license.

I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all,  but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.    And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Charles Parr, on the Tue, 20 Apr 93 21:25:10 GMT wibbled:  : >If Satan rode a bike (CB1000?) would you stop to help him?  : Of course!

Used printers are fine, non-apple printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:  Required features:  - PostScript  - 300 dpi  - emough memory to download fonts  - The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.   Nice things:  - anything over 4 pages per minute  - scsi output for a font disk  - smallish footprint    Don't Care About:  - PostScript Level II  - networking (its just for me, and always will be)  - color   I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow. I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's experience with it, tho.   I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot and the first to admit it. :)   I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.   Printers I've been looking at:   - used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that   only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?  - Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee   discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably   cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning   towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.  - LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't   seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a \\\"postscript upgrade.\\\"   ??  - Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and   they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?  - I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.   Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),   but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.   Thanks for any comments...   \",\"I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, should be offered free to the American public. This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure.

Only by washing these prayers with Christ's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father.   \\\"First, I thank my God through Christ Jesus . . .\\\"     -Romans 1:8, NAS  Some scholars believe that this is Paul recognizing that even his thanks are  too unholy for the Father.

OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.

In the United States, I generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli newpaper.   What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past, more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud at the time).

The above conclusion  does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion  that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.    If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup   that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.                \",\" Had an '83 Alliance for a long time.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"Could somebody please tell me if there is a Dodgers newsletter on the Net, and if so how to subscribe?

By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Father's.

I thought they'd pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in ideological manipulation and cultural interference, including Vietnam and South America. A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in 1979 as \\\" a covert political and ideological institution used by the U.S. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and repression.\\\"   My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even praiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian. It's important that Christians don't immediately accept every \\\"Christian\\\" organization as automatically above reproach.\",\"      It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital  source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year, remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. The same VLBI was used to track Gallileo as it passed the Earth, and used so little fuel that it can afford to observe Ida.   \",\" There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.  The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced, translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.  Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is \\\"obvious to one skilled in the art\\\" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if significant amounts of money are at stake.\",\"Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?

If that's preaching, then I'm soory and I'll get off the soapbox.\",\"   \",\"           Nice try Deepak, but \\\"tough Whaler squad\\\" should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.  If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \\\"take\\\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \\\"winning spirit\\\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \\\"hot\\\".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their \\\"sudden death\\\" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the league over the year.  They proved it.  cordially, as always,  rm \",\"     ....................

Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt that if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the government.  Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

David\",\" Leonard, I'll give you an example of this....  My father recently bought a business, the business price was 150,000 pounds and my father approached the people in the community for help, he raised 60,000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and  Muslims he knew, 50,000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan, after paying off the Muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest, this is an example of a Muslim community helping one another, why did they help because of their common identity as Muslims. In turn my father has helped with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay  and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more fortunate in the community.   The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight! iThat is the beauty of Islam.  Mas  \",\"I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs. a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit.    At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...  Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated.    Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a way to take advantage of that fact.  Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course, you will have my undying gratitude.   Steve Verity    \",\" : Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.

[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who \\\"breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven\\\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \\\"where no law is, there is no transgression.\\\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \\\"what ever He says to do we will do.\\\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \\\"better promises\\\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \\\"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\\\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \\\"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\\\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \\\"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \\\"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\\\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \\\"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\\\"  \\\"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\\\" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \\\"lay by him in store\\\" with \\\"go to a worship service.\\\"  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \\\"esteem all days alike\\\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \\\"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\\\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \\\"on the first day of every week\\\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.\",\"Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that's a paraphrase of what I remember).  In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.  Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII, hasn't it?  Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.  How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something. A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the humanitarian argument that democracies should help other democracies (or struggling democracies).)   Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid. My two \\\"causes\\\" are aid to Russia and a strong space program. Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we only have gridlock on a congressional scale.  BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of thing I thought Libertarians were against.  Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue  and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.

The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and even a small increase in risk is significant there. \",\" I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant. We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony. Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools', and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.  The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important. If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned, the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far behind - only a few years.  Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing.  For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as.  Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an 'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't that nice?  While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future) you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption: Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect.  This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea. Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity.

Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can really hurt your business though :-)  The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100, the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\" Maybe you need to go into \\\\mach32\\\\install and set a refresh rate for 1280x1024.

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator?

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...    Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.   This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.   And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.   The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \\\"Burnsian\\\" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.   If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.\",\"Help!

The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"  I have discussed this with my girlfriend often.

First, however, we must find a church( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to find a new church community).  Anyway, I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God, they are married and are bound by that commitment. \",\"Walter-  I tried several times in the past to communicate with you and Susan, but you ignored me, and I don't honestly believe my letters were mean.

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"  I believe it's XtVaAppInitialize or something like that.  --\",\"It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick.  I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:   1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a      device?  2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?  3.  Are \\\"professionally\\\" installed CCs signifacantly better and      worth the cabbage?  4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just      that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple       needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,      the questions above)?  My father and I built a \\\"Veep\\\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time).
