One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.  It doesn't \\\"compare\\\" religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way.  \",\"When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows to dos, telix can not find the serial port.

Dale Erickson  dericks@plains.nodak.edu\",\"Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining 5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.  Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems. Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see the drive there's a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \\\"no.\\\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any other products from La Cie in the future.

We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought) in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please. If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But, unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif net police, Ted Frank.   PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.                         ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?

Expires:  Distribution:  Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder Keywords: NWO Ted Frank  Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed. I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via netmail...)  While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \\\"Argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um\\\"?! I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).  The issue that seems to be: \\\"Is the following an advertisement?\\\" Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...  1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken   *off the net* from last year. If reposting an article  constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post  did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one  had posted the address and subscription price of \\\"Newsweek\\\",  would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of  \\\"proof\\\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains  to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  behold, \\\"poof\\\", there goes my account. This one had an  address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!  If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get \\\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\\\" or whatever; they only get \\\"I don't like what that user is doing because...\\\". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.  In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \\\"Thanks for the info\\\" or \\\"Could you send me such and such?\\\" or \\\"Your posts are very interesting... keep it up.\\\" and only a handfull of \\\"Go aways\\\". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\\\"My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\\\") NWO Indeed!  Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.  Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction. Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started.  It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of \\\"interest\\\" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he \\\"attends\\\"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...  And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the  state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br,  Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for  Prevention Svcs, CDC.   Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992  may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age  (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for  adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%  for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National  Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others  indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                          AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88        Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance  systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance  in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for  the years 1983-1988.       Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program  and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.       Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal  alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.       Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy  termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several  collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89       Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza  virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually  from October through May.       Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance  conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.       Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices  of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO  collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza  viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and  territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.  Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.       Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B  viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).       Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of  influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced  throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual  surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates  for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.  Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:   o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs  available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing  a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how this would work out.  Steve.   \",\"   As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government.  Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet \\\"wiretap without leaving the office\\\" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"NUT CASE PANICS!!!!REALIZES HE'S MADE A COMPLETE FOOL OF HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF NETTERS!!!!BACKS AWAY FROM EARLIER RASH STATEMENTS!!!!GOD HAVE MERCY ON HIM!!!! \",\"                    ^^^^^^^ Huh!

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \\\"create,\\\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.       Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon      belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to      have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye            cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the            lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)            Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this            world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit            that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)            In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the            devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he            that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father.

The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \\\"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\\\" (Titus 2:13),\\\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\\\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \\\"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\\\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \\\"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\\\" (ibid., p.54), \\\"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\\\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\"                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   a) I think that he has a rather witty .sig file.

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level.    I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more police agencies to \\\"go rogue\\\" and try to get keys through more efficient     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on         a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation         encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to         decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.         ^^^^^^^^^^^  The clear implication is that there are \\\"legal\\\" authorizations other than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.  Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \\\"retired\\\" from intelligence agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.  Don't think it'll happen?    Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional organization, which for years kept \\\"Red Files\\\" on thousands of suspected  commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well.)  Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  will be a moral dilemma.  Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our police forces?\",\"      Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet \",\"  If this is God's attitude, then I'll think I'll go along with Terry Pratchett's religious philosophy:  \\\"Oh, I believe in God.

EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.

I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by Le Magnifique and The Great One.

Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.   The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits. Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\",\"who: kmr4@po.CWRU.edu (Keith M.

The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you, women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!  When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better.  Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem. A woman is aware of this every time she goes out!

By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.

Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It  ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it  ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's  ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the  ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives  ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this  ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be  ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for  ->ourselves.    Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I don't find it objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some people don't care for it and it is considerably different. \",\" OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:  Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense.  Matt 5:17 \\\"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\\\"  Jesus lived under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes.  Verse 18 says \\\"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished.\\\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last  phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \\\"accomplished\\\" what the  Law was supposed to accomplish.    Verse 19:  \\\"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\\\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish  people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.  In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he  must have received about \\\"doing away with the Law.\\\"  That was not  Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it  should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his  people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your  heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \\\"doing  away with the Law\\\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as  equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious  leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only  God's Law.  In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law  and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon  on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people  understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which  had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.  In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the  Law in this way:  [23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being  shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore  the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be  justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no  longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith  in Christ Jesus.  I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had  served it's purpose, i.e. \\\"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\\\" and now, \\\"we are no longer under a tutor.\\\"  The law has been \\\"fulfilled\\\"  as Christ said he would do.  God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \\\"last will and testament\\\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles.  It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity.   On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and  Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes  sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to  represent the \\\"mysteries\\\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism  representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7)  OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives.  Please excuse the long posting.

Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco, McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985)]   E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here... \",\" Do you realize how many smiles are crossing faces after you wrote that?

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.

We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.  Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better.  The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking  tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries  What tcpview adds to tcpdump: - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional  processing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1  New features:  Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the  file type will be automatically detected.  Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.  The hex format has been changed.  New time options have been added.  Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.  Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)  New flags: -R read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt prints delta times -tttt prints times relative to the first frame -W write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm's way.  Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?   Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of \\\"demilitarized\\\" or \\\"buffer\\\" zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to  do it themselves.   What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \\\"guaratees\\\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \\\"word\\\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \\\"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\\\".  Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and '67. Somehow, with that \\\"limitation\\\" on the troops \\\"powers\\\" I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \\\"guarantees\\\" by other parties, the UN is worthless to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \\\"ruse\\\"?).   Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is the feeling that it is better that \\\"many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently  accept our fate.\\\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of  suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian, Arab and Islamic groups.   From Israel's perspective, \\\"concessions\\\" gets it NOTHING...except the  realization that it has given \\\"something\\\" up and now *can only  hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so; to \\\"take back\\\" tangible items (land, control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from.   Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades  before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon. The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel  would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state  involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure  in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts  committed by \\\"private groups\\\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next  round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and don't be so idiotic as to suggest \\\"trust\\\" for the motivations of present-day Arab states)?  Ah, ok...what is \\\"different\\\" about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic  policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \\\"political factors\\\" but about those \\\"tangible\\\" (just like that which Israel gave up) factors that \\\"guarantee\\\" the responsibility of those states. Your assessment of \\\"difference\\\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions, and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing.   It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel. Tim\",\"     I use xwd and xwd2ps.

The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.

Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,\",\" That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone, no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written.     That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.   I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges  do so more often in private prayer than in public.  Link Hudson\",\"     We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu- tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\" Hmmmmm you know this happened to me also.

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were \\\"melting in fear.\\\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God's work?\",\"I first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to apply to the BMWMOA  \\\"The politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small.\\\"  Who cares?

If the answer is positive, you would know if ms-windows is a \\\"mature\\\" OS.    Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.\",\" Purists often distinguish between \\\"true\\\" clubbing and \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the difference being that with \\\"true\\\" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With \\\"pseudo\\\" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. \\\"Real\\\" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only \\\"true\\\" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.\",\"  > be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no  > materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids  > and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low  > grade fusion reactors.  I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\"Played in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, April 15 1993:  ==================================================   SWEDEN - FINLAND  6-6 (1-2,3-1,2-3)   1st: SWE 1-0 Peter Popovic      (Markus Naslund)                     6:10       FIN 1-1 Ville Siren        (Keijo Sailynoja)                    8:44 (pp)       FIN 1-2 Juha Riihijarvi    (Timo Saarikoski,Vesa Viitakoski)   13:12 (pp)  2nd: FIN 1-3 Jari Korpisalo     (Kari Harila,Rauli Raitanen)         6:48       SWE 2-3 Jan Larsson        (Mikael Renberg,Stefan Nilsson)      7:25       SWE 3-3 Hakan Ahlund       (Thomas Rundqvist)                   8:56       SWE 4-3 Roger Akerstrom    (Roger Hansson)                      9:13  3rd: SWE 5-3 Stefan Nilsson     (Patrik Juhlin,Charles Berglund)     2:20       FIN 5-4 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:23       FIN 5-5 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:44 (ps)       SWE 6-5 Mikael Renberg     (Hakan Ahlund,Thomas Rundqvist)     17:16       FIN 6-6 Jari Korpisalo                                         17:44               Shots on goal:      Penalties:     Attendance:    Referee:  Sweden       8 10 10 - 28       5*2min         6,799          Peter Andersson  Finland     12 10 11 - 33       6*2min,1*10min                (Sweden)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish  blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and  shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner. Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Now I just try to get them off my tail.  In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).  Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary. \",\"True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!  Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from Montreal.  Montreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)  Philly gets Damphousse, Bellow, Patrick Roy and a draft pick. \",\"  For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.   I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

I didn't suggest that all  government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the  comments above.   I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.  Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it would produce would effectively crush productive effort.  No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize that many libertarians assume that such a government will be  counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)  Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement that the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8), I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.  Well, in the first place, I don't support a \\\"socialized economic system.\\\" I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not the case that \\\"any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.\\\"  There are multitudes of examples where such a statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one example.  jsh \",\"I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.\",\"    You have done no such thing.    An Islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules of Islam in regard to banking. This is done explicitly by the bank. This was not the case with BCCI.   This is crap. BCCI was motivated by the same motives as other international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.

SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      \\\"On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.

But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).         Pax,\",\" Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim, and (2) those who lose.  Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff. Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return.  Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.  Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with the tax code.\",\"I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was  able to help me.

The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine, but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.  The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0  The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.  When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.   Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I would not even know how to do that.  Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)  Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  The majority of the discussion involving this \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?

The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.   DB... \\\"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough:     But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has presented no use of:   (d) historical context                or (e) historical content                or (f) other pertinent historical info   or (g) cultural context                  or (h) cultural content                  or (i) other pertinent cultural info     or (j) grammatical construction          or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count]   Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\\\"   MY REPLY... Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:     MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslin's.\\\"   _____________________________________________________________________   Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too \\\"heavy\\\" for the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... \\\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.   DB... \\\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?   Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that's the first criteria we must examine.

DB... \\\"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Greek word \\\"apagchw\\\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________   DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY...

The discussion is not about whether there were tanks   used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired their   main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is   ludicrous.  Awesley replied:      I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,   supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.  The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.  You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing.  Awesley went on:   I   spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was   down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10   minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's   Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of   Tonia Blanding, age 4.             \\\"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction   the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the   tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front   of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out   of the side of the apartment.\\\"           Well, it's not the main gun.    \\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?    will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main   guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I read   the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.    It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard   sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American   cities in the Sixties.  Awesley replied:     Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to   find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main   guns.  I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  And on:   I don't   expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually   do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know   what you find.  I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\",\"Hello  as the subject tells all I am trying to find out what is the formula to calculate the ERA for the pitchers.

Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year's prediction contest.  AL East -- 1993  1.  Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to this:   -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.   -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees   -- Milwaukee was a fluke   -- Indians aren't ready to contend   -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better   -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \\\"replacement level\\\" \\\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\\\"  No.  As a matter of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some- body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \\\"You don't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat, do you?\\\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \\\"Glenn Davis?  That's insane\\\".  Yes.  So, without further ado: STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken. WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be   the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.   (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize   the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3   spot, why not move the rest of the line up?) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota. ObPrediction:  \\\"The Streak\\\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in   caught stealing.  2. New York Yankees. STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American   League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes. WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner    factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far   behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to   win a division. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again. ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.  3.  Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie   power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.   Guzman.  Alomar. WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.   Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in   the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August. ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And   have a losing record.  4.  Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year. WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year. WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year. ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.  5.  Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix   Fermin. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace. ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.  6.  Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre   Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts. WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how   you will :->  7.  Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.   Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.   This year could be *very* ugly. WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.

The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?\",\"Sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone...  I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools. I reinstalled Ami Pro, and ran compress again, with no problems. I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had 0 bytes (!) left while FTPing, although I would think it wouldn't matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time, and I made space available immediately anyways.

Transmissable diseases like  malaria though are obviously another story.  \",\"I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers. When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4 wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.  Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts.   Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.  Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read open.  I'll appreciate any help on this.

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?

Check it out.  Tony\",\"We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \\\"I18N.h\\\"  extern \\\"C\\\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.  In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.

You are admitting that the actions of other people and the situation you are in help to determine how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.  If you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.  This is quite different from saying \\\"Employing force on other people is immoral, period.

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, \\\"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.\\\"  The deal went through with no problems.\",\"Could someone out there please tell me how I could get onto the Saab mailing list.

I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, \\\"How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation\\\", by Margaret D. Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)\",\"I'm starting an informal poll on goalie masks.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said \\\"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now.\\\" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!\",\" <...more accusations about a worldwide conspiracy against blacks.>  Since Jesus was born in the Middle East, then I expect his human features to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time.

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\" No, no, no!  Bill, please, don't nominate ANYone who pronounces it \\\"noo-q-lar\\\"!

The word harass means to  irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.  I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.  The number of people who participate in \\\"victimless\\\" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"note: i am not the original poster, i am just answering because i think this is important.

What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\"Hi Xian Netters,  God bless you  CONTENTS 1. intro 2. love your neighbor 3. reaction to posts    a. purpose    b. eternal life  I've been reading this news group religiously =) for about a month.

INCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST I won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out    I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded by God, he knows our limitations.    Interesting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base.

Of cause, the R4-version  did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass    instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition    (formerly XtTblPosition).  Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error  (on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the  model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText   widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of    zero.   Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the    width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup   or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on    whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource    file or not).

When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it is installed.    Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Terry\",\" Um, I hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site. They have no meaning on other machines.   You mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests which show no such \\\"chinese restaurant effect\\\" unique to MSG (it's elicited by the placebo as well.)   Like youself?  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?   No, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  There is also evidence that excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain conditions like stroke, drowning and Lou Gehrig's disease, just to name a few. This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid in foods.  People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.   I don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.   Sez you.  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies.  Infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  Which is not to say that I favor its use in things like baby food--a patently ridiculous use of the additive.  But we have no reason to believe that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely.   Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist.

Don't holler BOHICA at me!   ----------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that \\\"faith without works is dead\\\"  and, \\\"I will show you my faith by my works.\\\"  Remember James was  writing to \\\"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\\\"  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the \\\"Judizers\\\" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think \\\"faithfulness\\\" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.   I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \\\"keep kosher\\\" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.   In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that \\\"pistis\\\" has some of the force of \\\"faithful\\\".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.\",\" \",\" [deletia]         In the deletions somewhere, it mentioned something about chopping off of hands being a punishment for theft in Saudi Arabia.

You'll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.     One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.     Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they    could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!

The reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a rare example of governmental wisdom.  The limit has a five year moratorium on it, and \\\"specialist\\\" manufacturers will be exempt anyway.

Jeez...  \",\" Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System.  Unline Win3.1, it does not  run on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is primarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users.  Speaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that's  just to run it.  Also, I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs,  and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August.  The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.)  Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96.  With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob\",\"DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind.   The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year.  SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.

The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.

They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\",\"Can anybody send CONNER CP-321 harddisk specifications? It has 612 Cyl, and 4 HD, but I am more intrested in its time-out values,  precomp, etc.\",\"  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\"}In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in }front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  }jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch }into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a }better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than }from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.

It is a 3.5\\\" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the  drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the  differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production. I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold  105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives. Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to  getting my hands on one. -Chris Wand  -- \",\" And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting \\\"The fire's started!\\\".

If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a  modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all  O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of  the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier  requirements.  2.

What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window  manager's border for the main window.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

Sec 552, which was intended to prevent \\\"secret lawmaking\\\" by administrative bodies.    These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States.    It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.    It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property.    It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law.    The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille- gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations.

It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government. The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons.   The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession (automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.   As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians.   Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion.

The entire auction  will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST* 25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of padding).   All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit,  so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing  items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask. * Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as most of the material inside is in great shape. Excellent - IE-\\\"As you find them in the store\\\" Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten Good      - On down the line Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still \\\"decent\\\") Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by scissors).   A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is  missing (usually the insert) I'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until the bidding stops) * Again if you have any questions, ask away. * arrow      $2.50 056 - Fair     *- Top secret module missing - Bard tunes -  real maps TN.DE7     $3.0  073 - Good      - Forest of Doom module (detached but  included) - inner planes ykchev     $1.75 074 - Good     *- Combat computer missing - 4 dragons  TN.DE7     $1.50 078 - Good/VG   - Monsters - aquatic AD&D module (detached  but included) - Language lesson geoffrey   $1.50 079 - Good/VG   - top secret module (detached but  included) - magic resistance mayla      $2.50 081 - Fair      - High level AD&D module (detached but  included) - poison - material spell components UCCXKVB    $2.00 082 - Very Fair*- Baton races game insert missing - spell  research TN.DE7     $1.50 083 - Good/VG   - Babba Yagga's Hut module (detached but  included) - unarmed combat geoffrey   $1.50 084 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Twofold talisman module squidly    $1.75 085 - Good      - Twofold Talisman module - Clerics squidly    $1.75 087 - Good      - Top secret module - Wildernes geoffrey   $1.50 088 - Good     *- Elefant Hunt insert missing - Falling  damage - MARVEL-Phile geoffrey   $1.50 089 - Good     *- Creature catalog missing - Shields - sci fi TN.DE7     $1.5  094 - Good      - Ranger changes - Creature catalog II  (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 095 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Into the Forgotten Realms  module, detached but included ykcheu     $2.75 098 - Fair      - 9th anniversary - Dragons - mutant manual UCCXKVB    $1.75 099 - Poor     *- Cover Missing - Treasure trove II, some  pictures cut out thedm      $2.50 100 - Good     *- poster missing - city beyond the gate  module (detached but included) - \\\"raised dragon\\\" texture on cover geoffrey   $1.50 101 - Fair     *- Cover missing - creature catalog III  (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 102 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Valley of earth mother  middle level module (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 103 - Fair     *- Cover loosly attached - Unearth arcana  update missing - Future of AD&D - Centaur papers geoffrey   $1.50 103 - Fair     *- Unearth arcana update missing  geoffrey   $1.50 104 - Fair/VF   - Marvel module - thieves - cover detached  but included                                                                  geoffrey   $1.50 105 - Fair      - AD&D module - invisibility - cover & back  cover detached but included       UCCXKVB    $2.00 106 - Fair      - Cover 1/2 on - variations of paladins -  more skills 4 rangers ykcheu     $2.75 106 - Good/VG   - Variations of paladins - more skills for  rangers     arrow      $2.50 107 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Dragons of glory  supplement/questionaire geoffrey   $1.50 108 - Good      - Mutant manual II - environmental  effects - cover taped reinforced thedm      $2.00 108 - Very Good - Mutant manual II - environmental effects  ykcheu     $2.25 109 - Good      - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster geoffrey   $1.50 109 - Very Fair - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster  missing geoffrey   $1.50 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv squidly    $1.75 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv geoffrey   $1.50 111 - Good      - Murder Mystery AD&D module ykcheu     $2.50 112 - Very Good - Ultimate Article Index - Mesozoic monsters mayla      $2.50 114 - Very Fair - Elven Cavalier - remorhaz - Witch NPC class ykcheu     $1.75 115 - Good      - Theives - harpies & snakes squidly    $1.75 116 - Good/VG   - 3-D ship cardboard insert - wild  animals - dr who UCCXKVB    $2.50 117 - Good/VG   - Dice odds - creative campaigns - sage  advice - bazaar geoffrey   $1.50 118 - Good      - Tournaments/Competitions - Nibar's keep game UCCXKVB    $2.00 120 - VG/EX     - April fool's issue UCCXKVB    $2.00 121 - Excellent - Oriental adventures - cardboard castle  insert geoffrey   $1.50 122 - Excellent - 11th aniversary - African beasts - druids UCCXKVB    $2.50 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry thedm      $2.25 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry arrow      $2.5  124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire UCCXKVB    $2.25 124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire geoffrey   $1.50 125 - Very Good - Clay-O-Rama!

I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.

The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.  In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For normal driving go with the manual. \",\"Yeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3.

Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one of the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a straightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about the DSS.  (This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Brown's _Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_.)  Nichael\",\"   The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older rare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:  Ford GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of  its races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.  Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?  Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)  THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model that I couldn't identify.  And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.  Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly sold in the U.S.  And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini. The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator  in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk and go to the outside from here.

For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.  You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line.  I guess I'd simplify this to say that 'waste' is a slippery concept.  If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its not 'wasted' money.

It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to actively prevent runs would be much weaker.   If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was \\\"Pitching and defense win championships\\\", and later \\\"Pitching is the essence of baseball\\\".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was \\\"your  point\\\", and neither of which is true.   And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?   It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low- scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

They are not.  I have written this reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling to the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no one, except myself ;-)]    [...]    Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced  mental facilities which have not developed \\\"religion\\\" as a  satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?   Further, it appears that only humans have a \\\"need\\\" to explain the  unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,  including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly  content in their ignorance.   I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me  from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal  *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need  not be researched; 3) religion was \\\"made up\\\" by humans to address a  perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that  is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical  structure with biology at the apex).   Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the  underlying presuppositions.    I disagree that Christianity is \\\"an infectious cult\\\".  It has  certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in  spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.  That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is  \\\"infectious\\\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides  a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this  is the case).   I disagree that Christianity is \\\"a safety blanket\\\" which supplants  hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one  Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a  Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to  you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose  and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of  control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?   Finally, one does not appropriate \\\"eternal happiness\\\" by following  Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance  of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people  from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the  Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian  in the Person of God's Spirit.   Heaven is one of two final states that  Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally  not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this  promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived  benefits to them in the here-and-now.    Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a  priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this  as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate  priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,  convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).  Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting  the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits  of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful  that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask  \\\"Why?\\\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-  plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it  does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian  is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of  friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot  evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or  harm others if the sole purpose of being a \\\"friend\\\" is to gain a  conversion).   As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-  ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \\\"hurry-up\\\"  attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no  conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was  coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open  to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).  The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings  conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part  (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.    We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die  just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more  than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is  so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find  a more expansive view.   (For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing  arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language  of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?  How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social  structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)    Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.  Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not  a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship  with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-  knit relationship with this appelation.    There are \\\"Jesus freaks\\\" who let the emotional aspects of worship  and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,  this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these  things flow.    Guilty by association?  That \\\"christianity\\\" which forces itself  upon another is not Christianity at all.    You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened  2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?   I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole  result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years  gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert  that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.    Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it.   While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.   I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.   There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\",\" This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.  You are making claims about what 'is' or 'is not' part of this program.  But if the \\\"block grants\\\" go to states and cities, the mayors list is VERY relivent.     Okay scarasm does deserve sacrasm, but I already contact my local officals, my congress rep., senators, Watch evening news, news programs, and C-SPAN.      The fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste programs that already exist.  Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating the DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!    There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs  from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by  changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).  True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.    Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not  specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.  --  ======================================================================  Ken M.

Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.   Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI.

Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].) I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.  Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:  - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all   phones with wiretap chips? - How much would it cost to make each chip? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place? - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been   if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed   \\\"law enforcement blocks\\\"? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?  Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\"  Does anyone know how to convert a targa or similar 24 bit picture into a list  of R G B values and then convert back to targa after doing operations on the p ixels R G B codes. ex.

God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

And key size is one of the things that can be    verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the    chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the    output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output    bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.     If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that    some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that    they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output    change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think    NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits wouldn't turn up anything interesting.     Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see    the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased    subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 2^80 encryptions.

The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\" There you go.  COM1 and COM3 use the same IRQ, therefore you can't use a mouse on COM3 and a modem on COM1, or vice versa.  It's a limitation of DOS.  And in fact Windows will not see a mouse on anything other than COM1 or COM2.  Accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new computer.   No.  The advice above applies....\",\"I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:     /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I do:     XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).  Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?\",\"       signed contract for EV Landshut, Germany      for the 1993/94 season        EC Hedos Muenchen, Germany      since 1992.   Holger  \",\" I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.)\",\"==== If that were true, I'd go for it.. I have a few friends who we could pool our resources and do it.. Maybe make it a prize kind of liek the \\\"Solar Car Race\\\" in Australia.. Anybody game for a contest!\",\"I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first, very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.  The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?  Thanks.\",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.\",\" Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0 and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.  [stuff deleted]   No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires.  The GTZ does come with much bigger 16\\\" wheels.   The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype supplied by Acura. The MT figures are more plausible.  16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.   The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.   The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.   The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k miles, a rare screw up by Honda. Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR. \",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?  jsh\",\"  Brian K., guess what?  You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \\\"The world hates him without reason.\\\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.\",\" Here is one by Andrew \\\"Graphics Gems\\\" Glassner that I got from a collegue of mine.

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.  A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.

I've noticed that when I go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)  So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.  Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?

If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done, address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.      Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?   Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.

The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this. Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup. Thanks!  Ryan  \",\" Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.

Jesus is the head of the body, the church    B.  You cannot say \\\"yes\\\" to Jesus, but \\\"no\\\" to the church  Ephesians 2:19-22    A.  The church is the family of God    B.  The church is based on the Word of God only           Cornerstone=Christ           Foundation= Apostles=New Testament                       Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)  1 Corinthians 12:12-13    A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church  As for the question of denominations:    A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians 4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13    B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings)    C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle  Hebrews 10:24-25    A.  Do not miss church    B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. Involved on a relationship level in the church    C.  Must come to ALL services  Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.  Of course, more standards apply:    1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie, disciples).    Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul (natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of Matthew 24).\",\"Having had limited tinea pedis for more than 30 years, and finding it resistant to ALL creams and powders I have tried, I wonder why dermatologists do not use lasers to destroy the fungus.

But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\",\"  It is silly to make this statement.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

Even worse, if the phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target keys.)

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?

I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.

That's especially true for sci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.  I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my followup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your feelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an 80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one repository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out in this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search. A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number, and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys, neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant to attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect the subkeys even more.  Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session keys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This would answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you make sure they stop''.  We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record of the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant.  I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need more keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be used to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant; the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very long.  I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the back door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard rumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)

EDT         THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen,  two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our  national deficit and to increase our investment in the American  people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget  plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope  and opportunity in the country.                Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress,  which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed  the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support  of a majority of the United States Senate.               All of these members of Congress know it's time to get  the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a  fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.   Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate  have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working  the will of the majority on the jobs bill.              When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every  state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue  is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking  for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't  care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying  the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the  table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of  dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their  families and drawing a paycheck.              They're asking those of us who have the privilege of  serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our  economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working  with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some  of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs  plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on  jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet  national needs.                Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.   Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what  size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of  the American people.               But even as we make those reductions and the package  will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the  minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is  the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the  dramatic rise in violent crime.               So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an  additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities  to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the  fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a  matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as  10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in  communities all across our nation.              At a time when too many of our people live in fear of  violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many  people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their  homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments  America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that  investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.                I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep  the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no  mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I  ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight  for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.              I want to thank the police officers who are here today  and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here  that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to  rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the  summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to  talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement  concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country  to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and  a brighter and more peaceful future.              I say what I say today not just because it's good for  law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in  these communities.  I have always supported community policing not  only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate,  but because it cements better relationships between people in law  enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces  the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the  chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.              These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.   I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put  another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four  years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind  the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.                So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the  jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if  you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept  the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to  building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will  create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my  part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.                I want now to give the people who are here with me on  the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the  American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished  Attorney General.                 *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *               Q   Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that  the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over  the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional  dialogue?              THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have -- they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all,  I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's  a lot of support in the business community and the labor community --  people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden  of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly  many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the  strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision  that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general  tax.              Q   Do you personally believe that the American public  is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I  mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --              THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I  will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the  benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you  streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that  there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or  over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive  care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows  absolutely massive savings to the health care system.              The real question is whether you can transfer those  savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have  virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I  have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is  the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned,  they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an  affordable health care system.              But I don't think that has anything to do with this  stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first  and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.              Q   Now that you've announced your willingness to  compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of  your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer  jobs is one.              THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the  highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let  me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime  bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a  supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think  we need to do that.              I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the  enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately  and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people  with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be  done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the  safety of the public depends on that.                There are a number of other things that I don't -- I  don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator  Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole  called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call  him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we  discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said  that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at  least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could  reach some accord.                So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been  already, and let's see if they can talk it out.              Q   When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator  Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200  million, that you want that as part of the package?              THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word  for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator  Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.   But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I  wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a  reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even  more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the  American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly  consistent with that.              Thank you.\",\" I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives usually came in MFM or RLL flavors.

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.

And, of course, since the season is not entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey season is starting!!!!!  Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:  Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points  Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points  Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points  Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points (these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)  Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.  Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you, Esther \",\"  Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne on the ice can be blamed on him...Roger, he is a FORWARD.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves.     I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans, then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.       No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).    Also, isn't the point of \\\"professional\\\" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).   \",\" It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to- frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do  occur.

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).  White trash: \\\"White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the  word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only  with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell.\\\"  -- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-  qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are  mean as snakes. The \\\"squeal like a pig\\\" boys in _Deliverance_  may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell  white trash.

The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.   Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base can't do.  \",\" So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point.

It would seem more logical to say that since  the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity  larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.  Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three  times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.  So... whose promiscuous?  Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because  someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....

I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of but knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, you may be speaking of \\\"Public Missle, Inc.\\\", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.  Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more  powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of used at special occasions.  To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal  structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of a model rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights. These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national launches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engine flights.

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\" I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding that the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity (including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended pending an investigation.  I seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.   Welcome to Amerika!  \",\" I think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\" My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays they're easy, and the results are better.\",\"  I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"Actually not Jim.

Could  anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to \\\"fork\\\" GDB off as a  subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program, the  following happens :  PROGRAM :   main()  {            int x;        printf(\\\"enter x : \\\");            scanf(\\\"%d\\\", &x);            printf(\\\"x = .%d.\\\\n\\\", x );          }  OUTPUT :   The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type in a value (like 5), then all the printf's output comes out at one time.   Is there any other way, besides using PIPES to do this i.e., like ioctl or something else ??

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991.  Possible actions to take in response:  1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and more.  2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet, write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea.  Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one.   3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues.  Talk to those aides.  4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.  4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal expenses and lobbying.  5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then present your company's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold meetings on it.  6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP, anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers, etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes.   7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it modified. \",\"We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose  event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to  receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server  round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.  Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I  just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is \\\"acceptable\\\" interactive  response time.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)  Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"   The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode, which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800 does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip. Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using standard palette.    BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to take it myself).     I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA chip it uses though.    Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as  documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller  card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)\",\"I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBT/SIL.

The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.

[dictionary definitions of \\\"not\\\" \\\"disagree\\\" and \\\"agree\\\" deleted]  Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of  red herrings and smoke screens.

After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.

Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a \\\"theoretical structure that makes sense\\\" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \",\" [...]  Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US  has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada  from the Cubans to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion  of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).   Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess  we \\\"invaded\\\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have  invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles  for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from  Spain.  So if you mean by the word \\\"invaded\\\" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally \\\"invaded\\\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation \\\"invades\\\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...]  No, it's someone who believes in \\\"peace-at-all-costs\\\".  In other words, a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political  dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  \\\"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,\\\" you ask?  Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's \\\"bad\\\" to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be \\\"bad\\\" and \\\"unconscionable\\\".  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with  the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and  many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)

I can't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard. The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works.  I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.  -David\",\"  A typical example of seep-minded thinking. We all know that David Sternlight is a jerk, but I'm afraid that in this case 90% of the population will think like him. Realize it guys - NSA, Dorothy Denning, and the US government have already won the battle...  Unless... unless you succeed to wake up the people... but nah, that's too unlikely... The events are happening too fast, cryptography is a too sophisticated issue, and almost nobody cares anyway... A few thousand of net.readers won't make the difference, if millions are caught asleep... Too sad... :-(((((  Regards, Vesselin\",\" I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.   BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.  Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california, my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.  Steve :-)\",\" The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that \\\"the people\\\" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.  I quote:    \\\"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the   Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the   the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear Arms ....\\\"  - Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).  Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation.  Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   \\\"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the   United States, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\\\"    - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the      Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,      97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )  You might rightfully ask \\\"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\\\"  Well, \\\"militia\\\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \\\"militia\\\" as all armed men over the age of 17).     \\\"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time.\\\"  - Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).  The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     \\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason    for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last    resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"      - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776        1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).     \\\"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not    warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of    resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be    refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\\\"      - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in        Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).     \\\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;    as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme    power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;    because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute    a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on    any pretense, raised in the United States.\\\"      - Noah Webster, \\\"An Examination into the Leading Principles        of the Federal Constitution\\\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the        Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).  You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine it away.  I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.  However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get it out of here.

It may be \\\"irrelevant\\\" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say \\\"bias\\\"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, \\\"the bottom line IS truth,\\\" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you proclaim \\\"truths\\\" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what authority you do this?  Because \\\"it says so in the Bible?\\\"  --Does the Bible \\\"say so,\\\" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or \\\"disapproval\\\"?  Excuse moi, but your line of \\\"truths\\\" haven't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the \\\"preachers\\\" of \\\"truth\\\" on this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever. BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees: \\\"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips, but your hearts are far removed from me...\\\"  # Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \\\"granted the Mormon # belief...\\\" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed.

Look who's talking: \\\"jumping to conclusions?\\\"  You wouldn't do that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever.  # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.

The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they \\\"belong to\\\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not \\\"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\\\" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \\\"one\\\"; #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown \\\"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more \\\"constructs of imagination\\\" than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about \\\"the only true God,\\\" whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but #  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read #  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.  Sigh.  \\\"What the Bible teaches\\\"?  Or: \\\"what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co.?\\\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).  (...)  #  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of #  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.'

The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \\\"official doctrine\\\" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \\\"The Seven Deadly Heresies\\\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\\\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\\\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\"Reposted, without permission, from rec.music.dylan: \",\"Fucking news reader...

If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example, these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare much better. e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.\",\" In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\" Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?

There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used.

Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they are a few millimeters apart). I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly, especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark. Applications which produce this effect are: - the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2) - Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU  The machines use their built-in video and drive the old  Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).   The effect is independent of the settings in the following control  panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache)          and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).  Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?  Thanks, Fred\",\"The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply.  Sherlette   P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  \\\"It doesn't matter what color His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts.\\\"  This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for saying that \\\"it doesn't matter...\\\"  to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT MATTERS.\",\"If anyone's still interested, I have ONE Mattel electronic game left for sale or trade.

We ran into one of my relatives at the  bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away, near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \\\"What are you standing here for? Go home immediately!\\\" I asked, \\\"What's going on?\\\" He says,  \\\"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're  killing Armenians!\\\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.  We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our  courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were  about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice  or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35. They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and  throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one  has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a  guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.  We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School  No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families  there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only  known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani  guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was  nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We  were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our  microdistrict.  We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.  On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of  them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I asked him for assistance. I say, \\\"We're in School No. 33, we need to be  evacuated.\\\" Well he says, \\\"Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.\\\"  I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with him personally. When I called he said, \\\"Muslimzade here.\\\"  About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \\\"Armenians, come  out, we're here to get you.\\\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in  their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \\\"Where should I go?\\\" I  say, \\\"If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that  the Armenians were here and that they left.\\\" That's what he did. He went down  there and said, \\\"The Armenians were here,\\\" he said, \\\"I let them out the back  door, they went that way.\\\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and  noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.  So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that  we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the  morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.  In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers  took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there  were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,  about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,  nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his  mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...  I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,  with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of  them.  There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,  everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage  was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to  get the things any cheaper.  I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we  worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw  me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his  feelings, of course.

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you  souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of  copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to  the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the  protection.  One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape  for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an  extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want  to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.\",\"How about posting one of her replies to your letters?\",\"   Just as a matter of interest, a self-promo computer graphics sequence  that one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of years ago showed a 3D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the East.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to  cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               \",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.       Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game, let's compare our decision to one of the most \\\"Boneshead\\\", right?  Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a  career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  - laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess Mieske has a future.)  (I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)     aw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN's admit they're wrong.    -- The Beastmaster \",\"Does XDM work with DECnet?

As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following are reasonable conclusions:  1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus. 2. The cause it not understood. 3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it. 4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with any of these experimental drugs. 5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep. 6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes abates or goes away after a few months. 7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people. 8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US. 9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed. 10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes. 11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there is not.\",\"Hello,  I am looking for a Xterm emulator which runs under windows 3.1.  Please reply via E-mail.  Thanks.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.  Serdar Argic\",\" She hasn't.

Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.  Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:                  WOOF!

When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.  In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray- way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today. He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and Quinn in my estimation.  I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.\",\" I like my power windows. I think they're worth it.

Crullerian photography isn't educational, except in a purely satiric sense.   Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope. Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes, and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes.

If the (naive) market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard, but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better, the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. Who could compete?

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as   I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement   between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel   revise this preliminary draft as necessary:    1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform      or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female      Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but      young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of      Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further      provocation is required.    2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant      Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans      without positive identification as military personnel, clear      indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.      a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for        Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively        military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or        self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note        that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,        AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive        military identification and require closer inspection such        as document checks.      b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,        which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less        than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals        of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a        single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,        as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.        As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to        originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify        armed response.      c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive        military identification of all personnel in the target area of        the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not        be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft        are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the        papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously        civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of        uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov        coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to        land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should        first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.        For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters        is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated        if necessary.\",\"So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point.

In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\" I don't think that's a problem.  My face is quite oily too.  I had a moderate acne problem for many years.

I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min (don't ask ;->) but acne is not a real problem anymore. \",\"What in blazes is going on with Wayne Matson and gang down in Alabama?

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next \\\"official\\\" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?  One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, \\\"blast\\\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

You don't give enough information to be able to compare the two situations. If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music  into the landlord's home all day and night, then I could see how the opinion would be justified.  But this court order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy of anyone inside the clinic.     Perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public property.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters  outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the  protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how  is that different from the abortion protesters asking women  to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?     Even if the protesters' speech could be considered \\\"harassment\\\" (which it is not), hate speech laws have  generally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see  how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is  murder'' could be considered harassment.   Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying quietly on a public sidewalk.  Yeah, I could see how that might be equivalent to \\\"bombing\\\" and \\\"murder\\\". Uh huh.  Let us know when you get a grip on reality.    \",\"  .  .  .  Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father \\\"to let this cup pass from Him\\\", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From John:  JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they             began to say, \\\"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the             world.\\\" JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by             force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion. \",\"Hello Hockey fans. Bonjour tout le monde!

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \\\"hot\\\" turbine to final stage \\\"cold\\\" turbine).

I dont know if it is true or not, but this is what I have been told.  What do you guys think?\",\"  Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.  As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap!

Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.   That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.   True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.

Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\"I believe it goes or will go: 680060 powerPC Pentium 680040 486 680030 386 680020 286=680000  In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was  slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel.

It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.

When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.

In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.

Hey, like the grrreat J.R. \\\"Bob\\\" Dobbs says, you've got to pull the wool over your *own* eyes! \",\"   The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows that we haven't forgotten about it.  Hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible.   --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1114\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1113\"}},\"id\":\"1065\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1098\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"callback\":null},\"id\":\"1052\",\"type\":\"TapTool\"},{\"attributes\":{\"overlay\":{\"id\":\"1056\"}},\"id\":\"1054\",\"type\":\"LassoSelectTool\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"id\":\"1112\",\"type\":\"AllLabels\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"formatter\":{\"id\":\"1108\"},\"group\":null,\"major_label_policy\":{\"id\":\"1109\"},\"ticker\":{\"id\":\"1047\"}},\"id\":\"1046\",\"type\":\"LinearAxis\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"field\":\"fill_alpha\"},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.4},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1079\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"fill_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"value\":0.1},\"line_color\":{\"field\":\"color\"},\"size\":{\"field\":\"size\"},\"x\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_0\"},\"y\":{\"field\":\"embed_2d_1\"}},\"id\":\"1080\",\"type\":\"Circle\"},{\"attributes\":{\"callback\":null,\"tooltips\":\"<div class=\\\"out tooltip\\\">\\n\\n    <div>\\n        <span style=\\\"font-size: 16px;
