My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \\\"AT     keyboard standard\\\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time.

There is no such thing as wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at  Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead to be a legitimate charge.   I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.   No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee of the Overhead capital of NASA. Nothing that Reston does could not be dont better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on. Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is at a place where everything is overhead.   Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being  selective with the facts again.   If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your \\\"friend\\\" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year \\\"if the wrap were gone\\\".

I have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks Cube but I don't believe this question has been answered.  Notice that I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the  SHORTEST path, not just any solution.

That seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to  know if someone has significantly improved on that.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?\\\"\",\" I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.  It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.  No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come to a stop with the rubber side up.  The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .

(Don't think I'm going to say, \\\"spend it to educate  people\\\", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on   things like drug treatment programs.  I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually  prescribe and addict his \\\"recommended\\\" dosage, and try to ween him off from it, or cut the amount down to levels where it is \\\"acceptable\\\".  Sounds good so far  from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out  the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)  However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be  bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a  recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD. The 60 Minute Report said it worked with \\\"cocaine\\\" cigarettes, pot and heroin.\",\"Yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is an uninterpreted observation.

Let's take me and Dennis Kriz as examples. We're in pretty different situations, but I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. I don't think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally acceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference of situations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel-words to me, Frank.   That's up to you, I guess.  This 'different situations' stuff is pretty confusing, Frank. How do we decide if we are in the same situation?

Please spread the word!  Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"From: brad@clarinet.com (Brad Templeton)   Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless  you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent  escrow houses.

THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases.  RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price. Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices. For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss  their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.\",\"I wanted to create a postcript file with Win#.1, to print it on a laserwriter II.

However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies. Not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources.     In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.\",\"I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.  Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.  LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.  Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya.  The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.  This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one month.

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction  opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.  Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.

The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...  Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.  Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there (no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? Is there something else that I could do?  A long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about altitude adjustment.  Has anyone saved the messages?  Many thanks,\",\"    Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.  Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.    The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:   1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently     most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or     dictators.\",\"+ +I love the idea of an inflatable 1-mile long sign....

According to Luke 3:23     And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:     And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not \\\"known\\\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of \\\"how this could be\\\" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's \\\"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity\\\", \\\"The Gospel of St. Luke\\\", and \\\"The Gospel of St. Matthew\\\".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.\",\" You must be _incredibly_ bored.  Have you considered reading the phone book? --  \",\"with model toward\",\"  Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by \\\"question authority\\\". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say \\\"I question to word of this authority\\\" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be \\\"authenticate authority.\\\" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.   \",\"  Gee, I feel so ignorant now...

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.

To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.\",\"MJM>HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related MJM>subjects.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\"Two LH Research SM11-1 power supplies (series SM10).  1000W, 5V, 200A (currently wired for 115VAC)  Control lines: +/- sense, on/off, pwr. fail, high/lo margin, current monitor  (List price from LH Research $824.00 each, qty. 1-9)  Asking $350.00 for the pair obo\",\" I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed, but God knows.

It's marketed under the name \\\"DAYpro\\\", and appears to be an anti-inflammatory.  Is it similar to naproxin?  Stronger?  TIA\",\" Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, \\\"better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead.\\\" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \\\"the turning point of time\\\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as \\\"doctrine\\\" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out. \",\" But the Question was later revealed to be:  What is 9 x 6?

This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \\\"truth\\\" is not always \\\"true\\\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \\\"There are no absolutes\\\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.   So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.  \",\"       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Is this Tony Esposito?  If memory serves me correctly, Chicago.

TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.

CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.

Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O.

Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\" Excuse me but... have not all Macs got a CPU!!!\",\"  If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.

The atrocities committed by the Armenian   volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the   Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the   fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties.

After one thousand years,  Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\"        Anaheim.\",\"The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality.

It is ISBN 0-13-020637-7.  Paraphrased from the outside back cover:      FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,     and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library     subroutines that promote fast development of application programs     for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.  The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a \\\"shell-like\\\" environment of the \\\"fmli\\\" program and it's database files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

By such a back- door (in the encryption algorithm perhaps) it would be possible (for   the manufacturer) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in  one session. This would not, btw, enable anybody else to retrieve the  keys in the same way because they'll never get a bunch of 300 (N,U)  pairs with identical S1 and S2. (Note that these have to be constant  for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure, i.e., they  have to be typed in manually by the `random number supplying agents'!)  And I was wondering why they'll always do 300 chips in one session ...  Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the  production of every chip (at least three persons for one hour each,  plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular,  Hollywood-like bonfire; add travelling expenses, drinks and lighting,  divide the sum by 300) there won't be a larger demand -- not from the  private sector anyway.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my masters.

Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"I recently ftp'd Al's Circuit Simulator (ACS) and I'm looking for the tutorial which is mentioned in the Users Manual (but not found there).

That torque, and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor.  To a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice.  Unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice.   To ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive.

The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system.

Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father \\\"to let this cup pass from Him\\\", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From John:  JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they             began to say, \\\"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the             world.\\\" JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by             force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion. \",\"   [Stuff deleted]    I'm glad to see that someone is working on this.

Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US  Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.  At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC, Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government.  Ahmet said \\\"our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights. What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid.\\\" He added: \\\"What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination.\\\"  Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said \\\"We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States.\\\"  \\\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are not hired to the government offices.\\\"  \\\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career.\\\"  \\\"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk.\\\"  \\\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\\\"  In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the Turkish candidates.  Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.  In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.   Serdar Argic\",\"    I have had the exact same problem, but have not figured out a solution.

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,  the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated  in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself. During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Armenians should look to their own history and see    the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with  their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on  their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and  more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a  handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop  'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \\\"What's going on?\\\" Someone tells me, \\\"Come listen.\\\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \\\"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \\\" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \\\"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\\\" I even heard that: \\\"All  Moscow is behind us.\\\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \\\"Down with the Armenians!\\\" and \\\"Death to the Armenians!\\\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \\\"No, let's stay at home instead.\\\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \\\"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\\\" Now what did they  mean by \\\"living like we have been?\\\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \\\"kill them\\\" over the microphone, I only heard \\\"beat them and  drive them out.\\\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \\\"Ermeni oryum\\\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \\\"Death to  Armenians!\\\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \\\"Death to Armenians!\\\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \\\"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\\\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \\\"Let's go upstairs.\\\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \\\"The Corner,\\\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as  persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price  information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National  Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  \\\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\\\" Torrey said.   \\\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\\\"  More BIO: In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.  \\\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\\\", said Torrey, 58, a native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm Beach.

Chris -- \",\"Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.

I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try?  Thanks for any advice. \",\" First, I enjoyed reading your post.

Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates that they are playing better team defense.   We'll see.  It'll be fun.\",\"It's like refusing 'God's kingdom come'.  In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.  [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?    A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.    XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com).

Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

There is no easy way.

Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\" If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).   Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?  It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.   I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.   Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous. \",\"I have posted the logos of the NL East teams to alt.binaries.pictures.misc   Hopefully, I'll finish the series up next week with the NL West.

You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF  crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in  such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has  already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer  and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible  for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering  Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically  calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian  and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government  as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

(Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of  pages, please ask by sct)      I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924) What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your groundless accussations, etc.    [...]      I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published  in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..    Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)    First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You  called Serdar Argic a liar!..  I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...  (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)    And now, you are lying again and talking about \\\"modified,re-published book\\\" (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..

Differences in the number of pages?  Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..  No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..   And you tried to hide the whole point..  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given   by Serdar Argic exist!!   It was the issue, wasn't-it?      you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?     You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \\\"crap\\\"..

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the \\\"swing\\\" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!  Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??        Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line        Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)  * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up    and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,   if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their   checking line against these \\\"finesse\\\" players - well then   let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).  I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.

Maybe a small FAQ-type thing \\\"Why should I Hate Clipper\\\" would be a good idea.\",\"  If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more  difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation.   The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military  in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.   In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into  this country has greatly decreased. This is because its  value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or  heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.  Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on  the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and  thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer  is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.  You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a  good dollar/pound deal. \",\"[...]  How ironic.\",\"While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently   when I bought a new truck.  I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.  Thanks in advance,\",\"... ...  Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\",\"   No, I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as belonging to the religion when event being judged applies.

There will    be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this    chip, like it or not.     If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the     access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort     would make \\\"compatible crypto chips for which no key had been    escrowed\\\".  This is likely what the release was refering to when     they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the    security of the escrow system.\",\"Ummm...did you have any bikes other than that KX80?

Tom \",\"Eric (\\\"Damien\\\"?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll respond to a few of his points:   This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of- nature.    Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source.    When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one the requires a kind of \\\"faith\\\" too.   By taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.  But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by reading Paul Johnson's \\\"A History of Christianity\\\".  From your remarks, it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and be animated by some enduring values.

BUT government  should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible  for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them. I agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make  money and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.

If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.   Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG) that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into the kernel.   I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.\",\" There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is  not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.  This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has  certainly proved that.

When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It is not a hostile action leading to war.    Oh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Jews.    Huh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no reason for Israel to let them in.    Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how is granting citizenship a facade?     Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to establish what it is.   Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.

Since rick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards.  This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the \\\"socialistic masses\\\" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards.

Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"Here is the story: I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.  Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT, and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.  What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do the trick.  Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that there aren't going to be any.  Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...  thanks in advance.\",\"Hello all!  For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D.

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \\\"I will be in you and you will be in me.\\\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase Sartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.  Your logic comes to fruition in relativism.    Ah, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrights's comment that Witt's \\\"sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.\\\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \\\"as a man thinketh, so he is.\\\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.    \\\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me.\\\"  Job 23ff  --Rex\",\"   Why \\\"must\\\"?  ---           \\\" Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. \\\"\",\" Yeah, Corel Draw and WordPerfect Presentations pretty limited here, too.

Emile Woo ewoo@unixg.ubc.ca    -- \",\"  Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\\\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\\\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \\\"95-95\\\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By \\\"impure\\\", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John\",\"I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.

Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.

I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.  Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.      You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will      void your warentee.\",\"Fellow netters,  I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space, but I thought you might want some relief from the \\\"So-and-so is a thief\\\" posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.

Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and when the Syrians agree to leave.   The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe they're not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who occupy their land.

It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap. Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem!  BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the solution less than idea, is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments.  So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.  Dani Eder \",\"  Ah, but why?

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \\\"jaggies.\\\"  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the \\\"context\\\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

(Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is relevant.)             The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.         Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)          This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of \\\"gotcha\\\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.          At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.          But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                         This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).          Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.                 The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as \\\"people who own guns,\\\") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.           If for instance, \\\"Bob\\\" were using his gun to attack \\\"Steve,\\\" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group \\\"people who own guns\\\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.          The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.          Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.          No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's \\\"wisdom\\\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be \\\"unwise\\\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.             I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"I haven't been following this thread, so appologies if this has already been mentioned, but how about   comp.graphics.3d \",\"     The problem is, your use of the word \\\"objective\\\" along with \\\"values.\\\" Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"I just love these posts from the ex-Soviet Union.

At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not.  And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around.  The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.

I've been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it  wasn't as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  don't find any foods satisfying.  Thanks \",\" I'm sorry about your friend.  Really.  But this anecdote does nothing to justify the \\\"war on drugs\\\".

We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \\\"You look for me !\\\", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \\\"government of peace\\\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \\\"Rabinic\\\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \\\"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  \\\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\\\".\",\" I don't think such tools exist either.

I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \\\"Mormon Doctrine\\\" is oftentimes referred to as \\\"McConkie's Bible\\\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.

And to be honest as well, I believe you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this? Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you. Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you because your god doesn't exist.   I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind. What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.   Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain  knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself   to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find  something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly.  Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not. Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied.  I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \\\"You will never be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\\\"   From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):      \\\"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;      to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\\\"   Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:     \\\"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\\\"   And in John 3:16:     \\\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,    that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal    life.\\\"   You are included in \\\"whosoever\\\".  And I also pray that the Father is drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.  You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul, proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.  Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would  probably say to you: \\\"Satan would surely like to have you.\\\"  Why so? Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did.  You asked \\\"Why not believe in Zeus?\\\"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life. You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus. \",\" That's might be what it takes to beat the Braves this year.  \",\"Archive-name: graphics/resources-list/part3 Last-modified: 1993/04/17   Computer Graphics Resource Listing : WEEKLY POSTING [ PART 3/3 ] =================================================== Last Change : 17 April 1993   11.

Bourke).   Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail   archive servers. Check with Archie.  Commercial:    Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price   is about $100. Their address is:  VRL  2341 Ganador court  San Luis Obispo,  CA 93401  Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515    Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 \\\"public domain\\\" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.   Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log   in as 'NODIS' (no password).    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,   no parity, one stop). At the \\\"Enter Number:\\\" prompt, enter MD and   carriage return. When the system responds \\\"Call Complete,\\\" enter a few   more carriage returns to get the \\\"Username:\\\" and log in as 'NODIS' (no   password).    NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of   what's there is available at present.  Earth Sciences Data -------------------    There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including   imagery. This listing is called \\\"Earth Sciences Resources on Internet\\\",   and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]   in the directory COGS under the name \\\"internet.resources.earth.sci\\\"    Some sites include:   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from         Magellan and Viking missions etc.         pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole         archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an         e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the         subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:          send SPACE Index         send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91          (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the         email server at present)    vab02.larc.nasa.gov [128.155.23.47]: pub/gifs/misc/landsat -  Landsat photos in GIF and JPEG format [ It was shut down - nfotis; anyone has a copy of this archive?? ]  Others ------   Daily values of river discharge, streamflow, and daily weather data is   available from EarthInfo, 5541 Central Ave., Boulder CO  80301.  These   disks are expensive, around $500, but there are quantity discounts.   (303) 938-1788.

Polhemus makes a 6D input device (actually a couple of models)   that senses position (3D) and *orientation* (+3D) based on electromagnetic   field interference.  This equipment is also incorporated in the   VPL Dataglove.   This hardware is also called ISOTRACK, from Keiser Aerospace.  Ascension Technology makes a similar 3D input device. There is a company, Applied Sciences(?), that makes a 3D input device (position only) based on speed of sound triangulation.  c. A company that specializes in digitizing is Viewpoint. You can ask    for Viewpoint's _free_ 100 page catalog full of ready to     ship datasets from categories such as cars, anatomy, aircraft,sports,    boats, trains, animals and others. Though these objects are    quite expensive, the cataloge is nevertheless of interest for it    has pictures of all the available objects in wireframe , polygon mesh.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17. Scientific visualization stuff ==================================  X Data Slice (xds) -------------------   Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT,   in the contrib directory. Available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50]   (either as a source or binaries for various platforms).

For other information contact Doug Norton (e-mail: 74017.461@@compuserve.com)   IRIS Explorer -------------   It's an application creation system developed by Silicon   Graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for   computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.    There are also two FTP servers for related stuff, modules etc.:    ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk [129.215.56.29]   swedishchef.lerc.nasa.gov [139.88.54.33] - mirror of the UK site  apE ---   Back in the 'old good days', you could get apE for nearly free.   Now has gone commercial and the following vendor supplies it:    TaraVisual Corporation   929 Harrison Avenue   Columbus, Ohio 43215   Tel: 1-800-458-8731 and (614) 291-2912   Fax: (614) 291-2867          Cost:   $895 (plus tax); runtime version with a site-license for a single user   (at a time), no limit on the number of machines in a cluster.   $895 includes support/maintenance and upgrades.   Source code more.  Additional user licenses $360.    The name of the package has become apE III (TM).   Khoros is very similar to apE on philosophy, as are AVS and Explorer.  AVS --- See also:         comp.graphics.avs  Platforms: CONVEX, CRAY, DEC, Evans & Sutherland, HP, IBM, Kubota, Set Technologies, SGI, Stardent, SUN, Wavetracer Availability: AVS4 available on all the above:   For all UNIX workstations.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn't have access to).  The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.   The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a \\\"this is how well he hit *last* year, in major league terms\\\" rating.  So, in essence, he has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.   Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place and last place, but no more.   Sure; they didn't have anyone better.

Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training could interpret as \\\"failure\\\".

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter.

Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.  The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).  And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.  Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \\\"the mighty God.\\\"  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead, your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.

My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago, signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...  Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street, feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance... Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid up beside me and asked, \\\"Friend of yours, Steve?\\\".  \\\"Shit, Matty, it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!\\\"  Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him. Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick. While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.  I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went uncontested.  \",\"   This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed encryption schemes.

Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----  Hi all..

Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government. This doesn't look very dietetic to me!   As I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to regulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to other countries to communicate their plans, and will still carry them out here and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)\",\"    Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the early Church use this particular figure a lot.)\",\" And I maintain:  Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the long hike, but it's well worth it!   Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much different as your god is from them...  Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept. Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good *reason* to, don't you?   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.   Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.  You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how can you say you have an open mind?   Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a good life.   Please do.   I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in which case it's not really all that important.

If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short,  the mind has to start somewhere.

If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done, address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.  You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?   [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between    feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]  T  F  *** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.

If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.

It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word \\\"apagello\\\" means to send a message).  \\\"Apo\\\" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word \\\"apokteiuo,\\\" which means \\\"to kill.\\\" In literal meaning the word \\\"apacgw\\\" means \\\"to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,\\\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word \\\"apacgw\\\" does mean \\\"to hang,\\\" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means \\\"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\\\" He then notes the the use of \\\"apacgw\\\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of \\\"apacgw\\\" as being used to explicitly mean \\\"suicide by hanging.\\\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of \\\"death,\\\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of \\\"apacgw\\\" (ie: Since the word \\\"apacgw\\\" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \\\"apacgw\\\":   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\\\" the the Hebrew say \\\"and died\\\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \\\"and died\\\", the correct translation would still be \\\"apacgw,\\\" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing \\\"apacgw\\\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal \\\"an iniquity,\\\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions \\\"an iniquity\\\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      \\\"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him \\\"Buy what we need for the feast\\\"; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.\\\"  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that \\\"apacgw\\\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \\\"Field of Blood\\\" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \\\"accepted uncritically,\\\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \\\"knows\\\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \\\"knows\\\" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of \\\"God\\\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \\\"god\\\". In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \\\"God\\\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.

May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.

If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.

A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:         title:       1994?       author:      Harold Camping       publisher:   Vantage Press       distributor: Baker and Taylor       ISBN:        0-533-10368-1     I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive, I'll buy one.   Over the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19\\\" monitor, more memory (20MB just ain't enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-) \",\" I don't know where YOU live, but this is not the case nationawide.

It is Red Sox 9th win of this season.\",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Herein lies the key to this thread:  Kindly note the difference in the responses.  Ed (and I) are talking about knowing riding technique, while Mike is arguing knowing the physics behind it.  It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering (ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without* having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones and such as seen in the parallel thread.  That stuff is mainly of interest to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^), but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering. Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  I know people who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was. On the other hand, I know very intelligent, well-educated people who think that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering a la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  Knowledge of physics doesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!\",\"    Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it.     This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current    configuration and restore is later.     Currently, my solution is:      XCreateWindow(...);     XSetWMProperties(..);     XMapWindow(...);     XFlush(...);     XMoveWindow(...);      It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering    if I'm overlooking something obvious.     Richard.   I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the \\\"user\\\" window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the \\\"user\\\" window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way.\",\": Consumer Reports once wrote about the S-10 Blazer that it \\\"shook and rattled : like a tired taxi cab\\\".  There is one noise that is expecially irritating - : the back window squeaks.  I believe its because the whole tailgate assembly : and window are not solid.  Anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have : you found any fixes? :  I can relate to this. I've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point, WD40, etc. Grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it down for a time, until the grease works out of the hinges. (Hinge pins appear to be made out of 16 penny nails!)   Another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the transmission in 4th gear. My S10 has 59K miles on it. I bought it new, treated it very easily, no fast off-road stuff. Can't GM build Chevies like they used to?

Johnson City, TN\",\" Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible.  Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds.    The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo.    Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties.  With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.  \",\"I just started reading the group.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a \\\"peek under the covers\\\" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"Mysstem crashes aftwer sleepp.  I use 1.0.1 enabler.

From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in  their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and  independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged  in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed  genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia  and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and  fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry  during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing,  rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the  Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians  engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal  they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million  Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.  And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.\",\"93!04.16 e.v.

Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending, they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).

I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic program for 3C505 succesfully (\\\"..passes with flying colours\\\") :)  Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..? \",\" Animal Rights people have been know to do that to other \\\"Bike riding dogs.cats and Racoons.   \",\" I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.

PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.\",\"  That I did not do; however, the sample bolt I took to the store fit rather well in the following:  1/2\\\" open end wrench, 1/2\\\" box end wrench, 1/2\\\" 12-point normal socket.

It looks fine. start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I get it to work.

It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.  Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players with different strengths and a bright future. \",\"Could somebody please tell me if there is a Dodgers newsletter on the Net, and if so how to subscribe?

So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:  If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game, the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game.

It fails for several reasons :  1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion.  2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language and not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from one country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality of censorship.     You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\"ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)    II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they are not quoted by the NT authors.  That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the  apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.     III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because    they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)    parts of the canon.     then I answer:     These is a logically invalid *a priori*.     Besides, we are talking about OT texts-     which in many parts are superceded by the NT    (in the Xtian view). Would not this same    principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?    This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn \\\"Now Thank We All Our God\\\" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"   The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.   \",\"I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM drives for my c650, but my local Apple doesn't know  when they will be available.

Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \\\"political science\\\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \\\"scientists\\\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \\\"nuclear winter\\\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \\\"scientists\\\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \\\"scientists\\\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \\\"global warming\\\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \\\"acid rain\\\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \\\"Ozone depletion\\\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \\\"discoveries\\\" on the  effect of \\\"secondhand smoking\\\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Ward  DoD#0710   \\\"Don't take life too seriously, you can never come                            out of it alive.\\\"  -?\",\"  Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'  and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians  committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of  despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned  them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound  hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated  personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most  unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \\\"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\\\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \\\"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\\\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \\\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \\\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\\\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \\\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\\\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \\\"We have never got any of the bodies back.\\\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \\\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\\\" Mr Sadikov said. \\\"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\\\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

So Mary comes up : with this ridiculous story about God making her pregnant.   :     Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close.    You missed the conspiracy by 1 step. Joseph knew who knocked her up. He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol' Mary prego. That wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. So what  happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and THEY decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been the downfall for both. Clever indeed. Come to think of it . . . I have gained a new respect for the couple. Maybe Joseph and Mary should receive all of the praise being paid to jesus.\",\"   I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"     Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of \\\"nuts\\\". This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government. This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was  created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line. That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press portrays a group of people as \\\"nuts\\\" or crazies, a violation of those people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the  gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk  voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.   Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the  official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information. So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification what so ever of doing what they did.    So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny, may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.  Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's (in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least). And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to  find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA. It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).    **************************************************************************** The above opinions are mine and mine only.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an  index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned  and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude  of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.  Now I would like to ask you:    Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to    this one?  And again I would like to ask you:    Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands   of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a \\\"Final   Solution\\\" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not   to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to   Jewish problems?

Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And  Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out, from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't their fault?

Verses:    1 Corinthians 6:9-10    Colossians 3:5-10  As for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is:  \\\"Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?\\\"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling question.  Joe Fisher\",\"  Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"Hi,   Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp.

I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in \\\"The sins of society\\\" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.

Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"The most current orbital elements from the NORAD two-line element sets are carried on the Celestial BBS, (513) 427-0674, and are updated daily (when possible).

I'm serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was \\\"rushed\\\", although there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \\\"rushed\\\"; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.  Anyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples' interpretations...  1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business. 2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have    disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think    the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style    assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other    noncombatants. 3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait    the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused    the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend    10-20 years in jail. 4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,    I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.\",\"This is a general question for US readers:  How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?

Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, but on these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.  The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped responding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make  my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then by pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me.  Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40  carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb.

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \\\"disposable needlesused here.\\\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too \\\"sharp\\\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to \\\"slide\\\" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical \\\"shot.\\\" when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \\\"squeeze\\\" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that  haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \",\" Uh, I don't think you can call a team with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Nolan Ryan on the pitching staff a team that has \\\"no talent.\\\" They did come out of nowhere, but some of the improvement was forseeable.  \",\": I am in the market for a bike and have recently found a 1990 : Honda VRF 750 at a dealership.

If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.   Scott   \",\"   The magnet trick will work.

I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.   No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally  stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,  but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors, willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.  I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice doesn't have a grain of truth to it.\",\"Hi!

We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck, makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)  Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.   Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly nothing to this 'revelation' thing?    Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?   Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.  Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake?

The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed., and  57% agreed that \\\"most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\\\"2      One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally, a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun, the completion rate drops to 3%.   1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY, 1986 -------  __________________________________________________________________________ [unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\":    I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available : in some form on EBCDIC machines.  Don't encourage them.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.

Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air rushing in. Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke. Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing) to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves.\",\"    \\\"Put not your trust in princes\\\" is the Biblical proverb.  The modern analog is governments.  At the time of the founding of the US, the idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  To a considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights.  Yes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of  a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until quite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.  Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are under real attack NOW. \",\"Wharf Wrat rites:   Ever' once in a while, you still see a reference to the super- slab system as \\\"Interstate and Defense Highways.\\\"  But whether the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is another matter.  A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks, maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I've driven -- \\\"Jeep Classic\\\" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus  Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.  But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.   Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.

They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without  explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.     But I'm a _member_.  Besides Bill, I hang out with you :)  \",\"   IMHO = in my humble opinion!!        I didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing to newbies.    Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??    Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago, from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left, but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was  right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster or better as a result, is absurd.  Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn. And that was my original point.\",\"                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the fire.

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\"How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting?

Best Regards,  Arno  -- \",\"    My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some truth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.    Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is \\\"a prime cause\\\" (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying it is \\\"the prime cause\\\" or \\\"the only cause\\\", just \\\"a prime cause\\\" -- i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century.\",\"    SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning' status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).  Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if that).   --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\"[about the infield fly rule]  Unless he's Deion Sanders, in which case he just heads back to the dugout and waits for his next base-running-blunder opportunity.\",\"  I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e., plutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain a federal permit to own such materials.   Actually, why bother looking it up?  From the material we covered last term (in 10 weeks) of Ge/Ch 127 (Nuclear Chemistry), I could *derive* what it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge, I (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly available chemicals in the garage if I felt like.

Exactly why science uses mathematics. QM representation in natural language is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology. Nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. Admittedly, not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept representations are the eternal hassles between religions.   And QM allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will be agreed upon as being similar. Show me something similar in religion.       With the effect that the models presented are useless. And one can argue that the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified - showing that it is bogus.    \",\"Hi everyone,  I'm getting a car in the near future.

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"Can anyone tell me what the difference is between a 256K DRAM chip and a 256K SIMM?

HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.  Eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\"  A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...   Bla-bla.   Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.   This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryption algorithms in commercial use today...   Except from the government.   Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip, they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to use it.   That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they are in one or in two of its hands...   Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false sense of privacy.   If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because some parts of its design were kept secret.   So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.   Except from the government.   Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.   In short, the new technology can:  1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.  It cannot:  1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its ability to decrypt the conversations.  2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who handle them, etc.  3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for communication.    Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as it claims.    Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.    That is, \\\"trust us\\\".   \\\"Security through obscurity\\\".   If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be trusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination and the ones built into your phones will be the same?    The NSA and the FBI?    Why did they \\\"forget\\\" the Academia?    Doesn't this smell to monopolism?    Like the Mafia?   This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?   \\\"We'll see\\\".   \\\"Trust us\\\".   In short, \\\"If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you\\\".   Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions and since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every American to bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter of right, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?   Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security, encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and is a step to outlaw strong crypto.    Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will leave the export controls on strong crypto devices?

Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National Institute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial and private electronics communication users.     The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing the encryption devices would be assigned two unique \\\"keys\\\" - numbers that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.     The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the keys are deposited in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases. Access to them would be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap, the White House said in a statement.                                -30-    Dan McKinnon\",\" What they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has access to decent crypto in the first place.  They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.  I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.

By trying to inject the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could be \\\"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\\\"  You still have not answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.   You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies. If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule, provide it for me.   More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out, brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant difference.  What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected, changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance, why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations, e.g. \\\"It really doesn't matter to you...\\\" If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic and show some meaning to your words.   As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here. A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?   Is it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.   You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments. But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.   Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible, that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said, you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said, there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?   You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.   Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and it is not as slow as you seem to think.   Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that he was murdered by a religious, \\\"pro-life\\\" fanatic.  Please do try to stay relevant.   Clever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.  What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.\",\"I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health.

Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.)

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.   Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun. \",\"(reference line trimmed)   [...]   Yes.

(BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit.

Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher priority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt5:14-19? Paul begins Romans 14 with \\\"If someone is weak in the faith ...\\\" Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?   Yes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say? Paul closes Romans 14 with, \\\"On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\\\" Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2 Have you read the Ten Commandments which are a portion of the Law? Have you read Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19? Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?   Whereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly clear, are they not?   Matt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?   Breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.   How do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and Jesus's word in Matt5:14-19?   Or, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in Matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were \\\"strong in the faith?\\\"  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \\\"God-fearer\\\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like \\\"family values\\\" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \\\"family values\\\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \\\"Law\\\", any more than people who concerned about the \\\"family values\\\" movement are really opposed to family values.\",\" : Regardless of people's hidden motivations, the stated reasons for many : wars include religion.

Besides there are lots of cases of police abuses ranging from protection scams to outright robbery (when I worked in D.C. there was a breakin at a local Radio Shack and the alarm company heard the cops responding to the call over the audio pickup in the store:-).  :What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, :at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that :a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your :cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the :escrow houses.  Then you would know that Big Brother had been listening.  Does he really want to let you know?  :Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are :laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. :Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time :limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.  :That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.  I'm completely against anything that makes it easier for the government to encroach on the rights of individuals.  The founders of this country spent a lot of effort limiting the power of the government and specifying exactly what the governments rights were (and this didn't include a gov't spy in every bedroom).  IMHO, there are entirely too many things going on today designed to preserve the government organism at the expense of individuals.  Look around and reread 1984 and many early Heinlein books.  Aren't there many parallels between the thought police (can you spell Waco Texas?), and Heinlein's ``Crazy Years''?

In your example, after accessing the modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by the modem.   Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free.
