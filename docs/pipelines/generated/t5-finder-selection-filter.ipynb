Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.  All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). \",\"}Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human, }we have *all* the advantages.  I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama, it will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're lucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and steal it!\",\"note: i am not the original poster, i am just answering because i think this is important.  [evil result of human sinfulness, rather than the will of God]  whoo.  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i think God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense God allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be \\\"held responsible\\\" as my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be saved.  he's not going to save us \\\"by himself\\\" -- we have to take a step in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence carefully -- i'm not saying we save ourselves.  i'm saying we have to ACCEPT our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would appear from what you say further down that you do.    [stuff deleted]  ok -- i have trouble with that, but i guess that's one of those things that can't be resolved by argument.  i accept your interpretation.  [more deleted]         ^^^^^^^^^ this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination. am i correct?  i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all choose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us. again, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved.  [yet more deleted]  yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by human beings that is NOT God's will -- and the best we can do is see taht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries me about the \\\"it is the will of God\\\" argument is that this will convince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i think that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more innocent? \",\"        Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?        But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.       I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))     I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...         Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\\\" ?      Consider the following statement:  \\\"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\\\"      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (\\\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\\\" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.          That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  \\\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\\\" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, \\\"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram.\\\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).

As a matter of fact, tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes them.

The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this was not necessarily their true position.   The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question. The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914 and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.     The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up a bit too slow.    The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded  as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.\",\" Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't, I'll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a real product.

Cheers, Kent\",\"Hi there, I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\"...   It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.

The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed.

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.

It was obligatory to eat a few while watching \\\"Captain Scarlet\\\". Does anybody else remember _that_, as long as we're off the topic of space?  Shag  -- \",\"  Good story, Chuck, but it won't wash.  I have read the NY Acad Sci one (and have it).  This AM I couldn't find any reference to \\\"weight rebound\\\".  I'm not saying it isn't there, but since you cited it, it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there. There is no index.

I found this article in the Rocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper.   SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked, said \\\"You're going to die\\\" and fatally shot him and two others, police said.  A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.  The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory condition Wednesday.  Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.   Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, just like everyone else.

The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job     opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of     \\\"Space Jobs\\\" features strategies for entering the space field and     describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and     non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate     schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing     to space policy.

HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON      Official names are decided by committees of the International     Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial     organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and     star maps describing where to find \\\"your\\\" star. These organizations have     absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they     assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be     able to see \\\"your\\\" star without binoculars or a telescope.

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,  available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. Center  Street, Manassas, VA 22110.       [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version      of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion      technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch      demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in      1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising      stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the      panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim      Bowery]   \\\"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications\\\", by  Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

Since it's rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.

First, I recommend the Sony CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.

He then complains  to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  behold, \\\"poof\\\", there goes my account. This one had an  address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!  If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get \\\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\\\" or whatever; they only get \\\"I don't like what that user is doing because...\\\". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.  In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \\\"Thanks for the info\\\" or \\\"Could you send me such and such?\\\" or \\\"Your posts are very interesting... keep it up.\\\" and only a handfull of \\\"Go aways\\\". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\\\"My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\\\") NWO Indeed!  Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.  Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction. Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started.  It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of \\\"interest\\\" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he \\\"attends\\\"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...  And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\"  Which distance?

Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length  is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.

Adams (starowl@a2i.rahul.net)   Champaign, IL / southeast AL\",\"  Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

I agree completely, driving drunk is really stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as  motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life  of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public against those of us who ride responsibly.  In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence. It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue, but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto, admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the  consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.\",\" Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.   Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled.\",\"  I think the passage you're looking for is the following.  Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\" Why?

Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).

The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them.

Thanks again, \",\"a e e GT (5sp of course)\",\" While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding, I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training  must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike  in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular. Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among  new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the  motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous. I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the  motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right  handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.  A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.  The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency  situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\",\": :So much for \\\"infinite patience.\\\" :  ;I find it hard to swallow that prolonged exposure to \\\"massive\\\" amounts of : :And they said that the bomb dropped on MOVE wouldn't start a fire, either. : :The real kicker, though, is the stated justification for the government's  :sudden loss of patience: They wouldn't be able to \\\"rotate their teams\\\"  : :This outcome could be foreseen a mile (or two) away, but Reno didn't even : :Malcolm Fuller, Surveying Engineering, University of New Brunswick  The really good part:  \\\"At this point we're not negotiating,\\\" FBI spokesman Bob Ricks said at a news briefing about a half hour before the fire began.  \\\"We're saying,'Come out.Come out with your hands up.

We had a discussion about it a while ago.    Then OFM comments :   With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference was clear: \\\"You have nothing to do with the Church.\\\"  These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called \\\"the nature of the incarnate word\\\", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures \\\"human\\\" and   \\\"divine\\\"  that are   united in   one \\\"without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration\\\" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \\\"did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye\\\" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \\\"semantic\\\" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \\\"To the  Coptic Church, faith is more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us.\\\"  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren't.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.\",\"   Why \\\"must\\\"?  ---           \\\" Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. \\\"\",\"Hi there, Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found on most arcade style games.

The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.   \",\" <. . ..  : The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites : take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except : for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- \",\" First, off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  \\\"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.\\\"  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.

A9        The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care   professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in  today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the  Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much  more [than  public relations].\\\"  ======================================================================    \\\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\\\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143,  No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)        Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G.

The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail  it a request, and it mails back the response.  Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can  have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server treats the \\\"Subject:\\\" header line just like any other line  of the message.  The archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an  index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.   1) The command \\\"help\\\" or \\\"send help\\\" causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file.  2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"index\\\", then  the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say \\\"send index fixes\\\" (or \\\"index fixes\\\"). A message that  requests an index cannot request data.  3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \\\"send\\\", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name  an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                 send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9  You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the  day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out  shortest-first.  4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If  you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like         path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or         path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.   The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If  your mailer deals in \\\"!\\\" notation, try sending to  {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of  vendors.   Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at  1.1.5.  An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering  information.  Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries,  header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if that vendor is an OSF member.   In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied  levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely divergent version of Motif:  Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well;   IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4.   NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3  and Sun 4.  Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.  ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.  HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.

Motif 1.1.2 is  also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced  Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?   Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.  Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses  the \\\"vanilla\\\" X11R4 Intrinsics, where \\\"vanilla\\\" means \\\"with just a few  patches\\\"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches  15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its  subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.   Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with -DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are  some known new geometry-management problems.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

The Free Widget Foundation set offers a FileSelector widget, with  separate directory path and file listing windows, and the FileComplete, which has emacs-style file completion and ~ expansion.   Other available file-requestor widgets include the XiFileSelector from  Iris Software's book, the xdbx file-selector extracted by David Nedde  (daven@wpi.wpi.edu), and the FileNominator from the aXe distribution.  The GhostView, Xfig, and vimage packages also include file-selector  widgets.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?   Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt  application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received user key and mouse input.   The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set  -- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a  core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number  of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .    At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???).   The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions.   The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution)  includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for  use.   The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  68)  What is the current state of the world in X terminals?

Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu  [128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X  terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it  is fairly fast and needs little disk space.  A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:  #! /bin/sh exec >/dev/console 2>&1 /etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0 case $? in   0) ;;   4) /etc/reboot -q -n    ;;   8) echo ND fsck failed - get help    /etc/halt    ;;   12) echo Interrupted    /etc/reboot    ;;   *) echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help    /etc/halt    ;; esac /bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1 /etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp /etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255 /etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11 /etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null set `/etc/ifconfig le0` exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \\\\  `(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

Adda  \",\"Printer model and specification:  Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier) ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)   Hello,  We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer.  We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The  copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the printer with the \\\"lp\\\" system using the parallel interface and can print  postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in  turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a  publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts  are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of  programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript  with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98  rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that  acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript.  We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality  pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the  SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a  warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without  some assurance that the product will work.   Here my questions:  If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or  parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?  Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on  the printer?   The Big question:  Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?    Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis.  I will post a summary.

But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \\\"plus/minus\\\" make RBI look good.   OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \\\"Red Jays\\\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \\\"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\\\"   This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...

To me, an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture, situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree with this definition?  I think you do:   A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  this is truth and therefore absolute.    Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all  scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and  coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.   Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare  heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew  up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) Can you reconcile this?   I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.    But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how to interpret the Scripture?    It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  on your own *interpretation* is absolute.

This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"    You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.  Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US, you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an added safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".  If you know of people that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...  ....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)        (ed@sunsite.unc.edu) \",\"Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \\\"Subject:\\\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic. \",\"  This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (\\\"forty days and forty nights\\\", \\\"pair of every animal\\\", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \\\"A big river  flooded for a few days and caused much damage\\\".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.

Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?    OK, \\\"this ain't North America\\\" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city having a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course, Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small distances between cities but still.    Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one of the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about 7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built unless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena.    Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has  5,000 seats I think.   If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work. Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for major league hockey.   ...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa to hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but showed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan and the smaller cities in the north.   Paris had their own \\\"Volans Francais\\\"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago. I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals  tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for  attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor  sport like hockey.   The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.   Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning anyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by  enthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy marketing, fans that have difficulty telling what \\\"icing\\\" means... London has been mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new mega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.   No facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500  fans for hockey. \",\"I don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you trying to convince?

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"-> :  According to a ``CNN Poll'' to key reason for Clinton's low -> : approval rating is people are angry about him not moving fast enough -> : on gays in the military.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on.  1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.  2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,   spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.  3. Remove the flopy drive.  4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting   the supply straight up and out.  5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom   side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.  6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and   right side of the board and sliding the board forward then   lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the   board must be removed first)  7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).   This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.  8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins   by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.  9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder    them in.  10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.  11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and    the other large chip just to the right of the processor and   figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a   simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole   in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using   insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat   sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.   12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

In fact, however, # #the argument is specious, at best.  More recent scholarship from the  # #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/ # #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in  # #the South prior to the Civil War. #  # This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital #  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern #  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference  #  in the capital to labor intensity.  Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.  Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not in 1850.  # #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's - # #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the  # #South.   #  # That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because #  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without #  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have  #  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come  #  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, #  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and #  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing  #  agriculturalists.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_ #  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.  This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  #  Craig A.

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.

Thus, Hasan is wrong.   The word \\\"troops\\\" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group  of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty. Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.  Incidentally, \\\"three times as heavy\\\" may be correct, as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs.  Guess why.   As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning.   It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the Palestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.   Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla.

It is not meant to give us anything interesting statistically; we want to hear what kind of voices there are out there. We are not asking for full- blown essays, but please give us what you can.  As I do not read these groups often, please email all responses to me at shimpei@leland.stanford.edu. As my mail account is not infinite, if you can delete the questions and just have numbered answers when you write back I would really appreciate it.  Since we would like to start analyzing the result as soon as possible, we would like to have the answers by April 30. If you absolutely cannot make it by then, though, we would still liken to hear your answer.  If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect would like to have the answers by April 30.

If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect (or better yet, include a note along with your survey response) and I'll try to email it to you, probably in late May.  SURVEY:  Question 1) Have you ever had trouble reconciling faith and reason? If so, what was the trouble? (For example: -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism                holds more truth?               -Do you practice tarot cards, palm readings, or divination that                conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world?               -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that                you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you?) Basically, we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your _REASON_tells you is wrong.  Question 2) If you have had conflict, how did/do you resolve the conflict?  Question 3) If you haven't had trouble, why do you think you haven't? Is there a set of guidelines you use for solving these problems?

They are largely out of order.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  June 11, 1992 tedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)   You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.  The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.  Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive calculation, I thought this did pretty well. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992  Hm.  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker.  And Bielecki wasn't released until the end of the year.  I won't comment on the bullpen.  (Jeff Reardon???  :-)   Right on Blauser.

Okay, so the Mets finished fifth.  But I got the Pirates and Expos right!   First half?  Dead on!  Second half?  Ummm....  I'm a Sox fan, go easy on me!   So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed.  :-)  I was at least *close*, and was right about Jefferies.  (Though I don't know.  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade?)   Close.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

The Negev in the Year 2000  Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \\\"the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\\\" was trumpeted throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \\\"It's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in abandoned desert areas\\\".  Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These were the Bedouin Arabs.  The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish pastoral activity.  I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -------------------------------------------------- In 1942, according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats.  The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers after 40 years of \\\"making the desert bloom\\\"*  The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing. Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions.  After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming.  A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army.  No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven \\\"development towns\\\", or *sowetos*, established for them.\",\" I think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  I don't think it is the function overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time in BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in porting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of invalid C++ assumptions.  I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that. \",\"ATTN: Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...

If you read Aviation Week, the C-5 line can be reopened and the C-5s would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the  program. Politically, though, the C-17 is popular pork.  Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf. The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.  Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.  In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being  required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"Hey now,  The following cds are still available.

FACT:  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license to do so from PKP, whether or not one is charging for it.

Therefore, the \\\"average citizen\\\" cannot use RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP.

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they \\\"faked\\\" a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself, let alone the idea of a \\\"space germ\\\".    Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's top lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be \\\"cracked\\\" so to speak by man or nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And the researchers used \\\"spacesuits\\\" similar to that in the film.  I'm curious what people think about this film -- short of \\\"silly\\\". Is such a facility technically feasible today?    As far as the plot, and the crystalline structure that is not Life As We Know It, that's a whole 'nother argument for rec.arts.sf.tech or something.\",\"The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) \",\"I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a great card especially with my multimedia presentations.

Thanks.\",\"April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):  Basically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied  territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe  continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they  leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that  the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tim:   There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in  exchange for pieces of paper, \\\"expectations\\\", \\\"hopes\\\", etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that these \\\"tangible concessions\\\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By \\\"tangible\\\" is meant something that 1) provides Israel with \\\"comparable\\\" protection (from the land it is to  give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine  **will be** accountable and held actively (not just \\\"diplomatically)  responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens  or \\\"visitors\\\").  In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**  co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel  from its territory.  Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  how *could* such \\\"guarantees\\\" be instilled? For example,  how could such \\\"guarantees\\\"/\\\"controls\\\" be added to the  Palestinian PISGA proposals?  Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \\\"buffer zone\\\", gives full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would*, if not \\\"controlled\\\" somehow) EASILY return to the  traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen.\",\" Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to make concerning aftermarket A/C units.

Nonetheless, I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument.

The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures) defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death....

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.

Jonathan\",\"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:  1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \\\"verbatim  translation\\\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place -- the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating. In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce  the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not  surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a  single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into,  urban-folklore style.  2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a  copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution  team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't  understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable  to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and  yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:  \\\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German law registry].\\\"  Bingo.  Exactly.    Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one under discussion.  All of the stuff about \\\"Why would a U.S. congressman have a copy of a Nazi law?\\\" melts away, by the author's admission.  He then continues:  \\\"But if he acquired the original German text of the  Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so  for a very specific reason...\\\"  But there's absolutely no reason to  think that this is the case.  In fact, as a \\\"senior member of the U.S.  team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\\\", it seems to me that he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether  the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red  herrings.  3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he  asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge  levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask  to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd  took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing  it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*,  wouldn't he?     Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it on their own?     Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question: \\\"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the  Nazi law.\\\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \\\"concerning the history of Nazism and gun confiscation\\\", Dodd's motivation isn't a  mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.  4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.   Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT a \\\"Nazi-inspired\\\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the  1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification  of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list  other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews; of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless, in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the  discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues,  \\\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68...\\\" -- so  as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\",\"  The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is   | x^2+y^2+z^2  x1^2+y1^2+z1^2  ...  x4^2+y4^2+z4^2 |   |      x             x1        ...        x4       |   |      y             y1        ...        y4       | = 0   |      z             z1        ...        z4       |   |      1             1         ...        1        | When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the equation in the form   A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0 If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete the square on x, y, and z to obtain   (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2\",\"I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to  override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.       What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.        From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.        The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.        Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to  actually take place?

But the Catholic Church considers us dissident.  If this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter, I'm sure OFM will let us know.

What I heard about this study was that in one 'personality', a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard), while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.  If this is true, it is truly fascinating.  But, I'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study really showed, and where the study is published.  Any help out there?

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If \\\"poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,\\\" this typical historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.\",\" Nope, you're confusing separate programs.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.  It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the \\\"plumbers\\\" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more.  WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows:    * Major improvements include:     - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new       features (FWF MultiList widget).     - Ability to expand directories in browser.     - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.     - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.     - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable       pseudo-weights.     - Online help browser.     - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.     - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.     - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Well, think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:  In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \\\"stick\\\" in the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431. You'll recognize this \\\"sticky button\\\" symptom immediately if you have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.  Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead  suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly (_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed) range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.  Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice. Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\"  Much of the OT prophecies have a double application: to the Jewish captivity, and to the end of time.

Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. I took him to a local \\\"Urgent and General Care\\\" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The  clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the  doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not  see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed  here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several  trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:  - the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,  - the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going    to the emergency room;  - the doctor would not even speak to me;  - she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;  - when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said \\\"I don't know.\\\"  I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still  trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a  letter.

I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.\",\"Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040 accelerator?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap (XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.

As an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures into the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and  developing a written language (along with teaching the natives to read). It is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments want the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the  Mexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not cultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.  To understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books (autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.

Says who? Other than a hear-say god.   You sure don't understand it.   Bill, I hereby award you the Golden Shovel Award for the biggist pile of bullshit I've seen in a whils. I'm afraid there's not a bit of religion in macroevolution, and you've made a rather grand statement that Science can not explain origins; to a large extent, it already has! \",\"      I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure', since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking. It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably happens.  Tripe a la Tommy, the new libertopian dish.    Wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?  --  \\\"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live  in the real world.\\\"   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\",\" The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police now confiscate property, without trial, under a \\\"good faith probable cause\\\" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a majority will answer \\\"yes\\\" if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs.  What goes around comes around. \",\"Gordon Banks:  This certainly describes my situation perfectly. For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday, but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check. This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.  I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.\",\"  Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.  I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what we can _say_ about the physical world.\",\"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\" Stuff deleted   I have to confess that this is one of my few unfulfilled ambitions.

For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the   UNIX shell prompt.      passwd - change password     finger - obtain information about a remote user     chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote              users (sometimes `passwd -f')     chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory     umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access              rights     ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories     xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an              Xwindow server     last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their              originations     who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations     w      - list other users and what they are running     xhost  - access control list for X Window client use     xauth  - control X Window server authentication          .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts     .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts     .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys     $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings    The 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's   \\\"etherfind\\\" although none of the etherfind code remains.  It was   originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,   as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve   tcp and internet gateway performance.  A current version is   available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at   address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar   file). This program is subject to  the 'standard' Berkeley network   software copyright.  _____ <4.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?    A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,   especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available   in FAQ form:    >  Compiled by:   >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)   >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)   >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)    NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)   publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special   publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal   (April 1991).  Available via anonymous FTP from   csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt.    Also via available anonymous FTP from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.Z   in the crypto directory.  Covers technical mathematical aspects   of encryption such as number theory.

Also   available as hardcopy for $20 from   RSA Laboratories, 100 Marine   Parkway, Redwood City, CA  94065.  Send questions to   faq-editor@rsa.com.    Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) public-domain package   for public key encryption is available at numerous sites, and is   in widespread use over the internet for general UNIX-based file   encryption (including email).  Consult the archie FTP database.    Also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  Mailing list requests   to info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.    From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen   <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:    > RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)   > using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows   > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication   > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can   > read it except the intended recipient.)   >    > RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan   > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain,   > except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF   > licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.   >    > RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent   > residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the   > README file for info.   >    > RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on   > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in   > the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To   > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and   > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.    Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet   and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.  _____ <4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?    Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list   dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy   in the digital domain.''  Send email to   cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the   list. From the charter:    > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.   > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt   > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for   > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will   > learn how best to defend it.  _____ <4.4> What are some privacy-related newsgroups?  FAQs?

Internet drafts on Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) describe a standard   under revision for six years delineating the official protocols for   email encryption.  The standard has only recently stabilized and   implementations are being developed.    - RFC-1421: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail:      Part I: Message Encryption and Authentication Procedures.'' J.     Linn <104-8456@mcimail.com>    - RFC-1422: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part     II: Certificate-Based Key Management'' S.

Kaliski     <burt@rsa.com>    - RFC-1423: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part     III: Algorithms, Modes, and Identifiers'' D. Balenson     <belenson@tis.com>    Send email to pem-info@tis.com for more information.  See ``RFCs    related to privacy'' for information on how to obtain RFCs.    _____ <4.6> What are other Requests For Comments (RFCs) related to privacy?    RFC-822:  SMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol   RFC-977:  NNTP, Network News Transfer Protocol   RFC-1036: Standard for interchange of network news messages   RFC-1208: Glossary of Networking Terms   RFC-1207: Answers to ``experienced Internet user'' questions   RFC-1206: Answers to ``new Internet user'' questions   RFC-1355: Privacy issues in Network Information center databases       RFC-1177 is ``FYI: Answers to commonly asked ``new internet user''    questions, and includes: basic terminology on the Internet (TCP/IP,   SMTP, FTP), internet  organizations such as IAB (Internet   Activities Board) and IETF  (Internet Enbgineering Task Force), and   a glossary of terms.  Also from ftp.eff.org:   /pub/internet-info/internet.q.    > RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname   > RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where `nnnn' refers to the   > number of the RFC).

Address the request to   > NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and leave the subject field of the message   > blank.  The first line of the text of the message must be `SEND   > RFCnnnn.TXT-1', where nnnn is replaced by the RFC number.    _____ <4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?    Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.

Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).

One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof on the part of the government before they may take action against citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should be available.)          We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S. Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't *in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.          I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in Congress.         The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork, from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week and I'm not on government assitance.)          Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.         In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of approx. 884 billion dollars.         In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In 192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars. That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs, Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare) cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase of 230%)         In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of 368%)         In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.         In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.         Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.         Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.         Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.         Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.         Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.         Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.              About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under  the Energy category, primarily under \\\"Supply,\\\" and \\\"Community Development,\\\" in the area of \\\"disaster relief,\\\" and between the two of them represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.         Where *was* this huge diversion?          Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to equalize once the pressure is gone?          Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want to continue. I see very little positive about it.          The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the brakes on the \\\"democratic process\\\" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense it gets worse.          Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be told, \\\"no,\\\" and pointed to their local government.

I haven't *based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.

Are they called \\\"liver spots\\\" because they're sort of liver-colored, or do they indicate some actual liver dysfunction?\",\"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can  predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration rate for violent crimes.  So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism present.  There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.  Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks.  In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).  Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

He who does these things shall never be moved.\\\"  ------------------------------------------------------------ Rob Coffey                    \\\"Indeed the safest road to  coffey@cptc1.neep.wisc.edu     Hell is the gradual one- the (if you send mail to cptc2     gentle slope, soft underfoot,  I'll never read it)           without sudden turnings,                                 without milestones, without                                signposts.\\\"  -- Screwtape\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                            BY DEE DEE MYERS                                   The Briefing Room   9:45 A.M. EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"I agree. I own one. Aside from the shutter, it is built like a little tank.

Good luck.\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part02 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 2: Net Etiquette  This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\" As one of the \\\"Clintonites\\\" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton's \\\"dishonesty.\\\" (I won't necessarily defend him on other issues.)    There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

Kings\",\"I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?  First Base:  Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs  Second Base:  Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge.  Shortstop:  Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.  Third Base:  Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida.  Catcher:   Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Field:  Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.  Center:  Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time.  Right:  Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs  Starters:  Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Relief:  Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.  Closer:  A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.  Overall, an edge to Chicago. Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course. e -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu    GO CUBS!!!\",\"   How can car be any good that has            S     N     A    C              U     D     N    E  written on the back with crooked letters as if a 2-year-old had written it?

E-mail me and I'll send it you...  Louis \",\"  First of all, \\\"ceremonial law\\\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\"_MY ADVOCATE_  I sinned. And straightway, posthaste, Satan flew Before the presence of the Most High God And made a railing accusation there. He said, \\\"This soul, this thing of clay and sod, Has sinned. 'Tis true that he has named Thy name; But I demand his death, for Thou hast said, 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.' Shall not Thy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead? Send now this wretched sinner to his doom! What other thing can righteous ruler do?\\\" Thus Satan did accuse me day and night; And every word he spoke, O  God, was true!  Then quickly One rose up from God's right hand, Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes; He spoke, \\\"Each jot and tittle of the law Must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies! But wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred To Me and that I paid his penalty! Behold My hands, My side, My feet! One day I was made sin for him and died that he Might be presented, faultless, at Thy throne!\\\" And Satan flew away.  Full well he knew That he could not prevail against such love, for every word my dear Lord spoke was true!        by Martha Snell Nicholson  +++++++++++++++++++++++ I heard this poem read last night and wanted to share it with other  subscribers of this newsgroup.  It's such a wonderful blessing to see how  secure our salvation is because the Lord Jesus paid for what He did not owe  because we had a debt which we were not capable to pay.  Thanks and praise be to the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is seated at  the right hand of the Majesty on High, making intercession for us. ++++++++++++++++++++++++\",\"Does anyone out there have or know of, any kind of utility program for  Ribbons?

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\" Our panel of judges has deliberated the question, and the answer is:  Send the requester one copy, and then gang-FAQ yourself.\",\"I was wondering if the FAQ files could be posted quarterly rather than monthly.

The number to dial is 211 for the same result. \",\"Scoring stats for the Swedish NHL players, April 5:  ===================================================   Mats Sundin watch:     Most points during a season:       131  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81  (49+82)     110  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86  (43+67)   * 109  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93  (43+66)     106  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88  (50+56)     104  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83  (46+58)      99  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85  (37+62)     Most goals during a season:       50  Hakan Loob, Calgary Flames         1987-88      49  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      46  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1982-83      45  Tomas Sandstrom, LA Kings          1990-91      43  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86   *  43  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93     Most assists during a season:       82  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1980-81      67  Mats Naslund, Montreal Canadiens   1985-86      66  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1976-77   *  66  Mats Sundin, Quebec Nordiques      1992-93      62  Kent Nilsson, Calgary Flames       1984-85      61  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs 1977-78      61  Thomas Steen, Winnipeg Jets        1988-89   Ulf Samuelsson watch:     Most penalty minutes during a season:    *  243  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1992-93   (through 3/25)      211  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1990-91      206  Ulf Samuelsson, Pittsburgh Penguins   1991-92      184  Kjell Samuelsson, Philadelphia Flyers 1988-89      181  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1988-89      174  Ulf Samuelsson, Hartford Whalers      1985-86      170  Borje Salming, Toronto Maple Leafs    1980-81   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  RL Rk Name             Team J# Ps Ht   Wt  Born      G  A  Pts  PL  Comment -- -- ---------------- ---- -- -- ---  --- --------  -- -- ---  --  -------     1 Mats Sundin       QUE 13 C  6-2  189  2/13/71  43 66 109   7       2 Ulf Dahlen        MIN 22 RW 6-2  195  1/12/67  33 38  71   5         3 Thomas Steen      WIN 25 C  5-10 195  6/ 8/60  21 43  64   5     4 Johan Garpenlov   SJS 10 LW 5-11 185  3/21/68  21 40  61   5      5 Fredrik Olausson  WIN  4 D  6-2  200 10/ 5/66  13 38  51   4     6 Tomas Sandstrom   LAK  7 LW 6-2  207  9/ 4/64  22 24  46   2     7 Per-Erik Eklund   PHI  9 LW 5-10 175  3/22/63   8 34  42      Injured     8 Calle Johansson   WAS  6 D  5-11 205  2/14/67   6 35  41   1     9 Nicklas Lidstrom  DET  5 D  6-2  180  4/28/70   7 33  40   2     10 Tommy Sjodin      MIN 33 D  5-11 190  8/13/65   7 29  36         11 Ulf Samuelsson    PIT  5 D  6-1  195  3/26/64   2 24  26   1     12 Mikael Andersson  TBL 34 LW 5-11 185  5/10/66  13 11  24   1     13 Michael Nylander  HFD 36 LW 5-11 176 10/ 3/72   5 16  21   2     14 Roger Johansson   CGY 34 D  6-1  185  4/ 7/67   4 15  19   1    15 Jan Erixon        NYR 20 LW 6-0  196  7/ 8/62   5 10  15          16 Peter Andersson   NYR 25 D  6-0  187  8/29/65   4  7  11   1     17 Kjell Samuelsson  PIT 28 D  6-6  235 10/18/58   3  6   9   2     18 Tommy Albelin     NJD  6 D  6-1  190  5/21/64   1  5   6          19 Per Djoos         NYR 44 D  5-11 176  5/11/68   1  1   2      Binghampton?

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"  dam9543>  I get back drom work today, look at me bike before dam9543> proceding in-side.

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D. I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged, especially syncs and groundings.  Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

We would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction.   To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C 5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated.   We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference. We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars B and C.

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"Turkish president Turgur Ozal has passed away today after a heart  attack in Ankara at 11:00 am GMT . Mr. Ozal was 66 years old.\",\"I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)          Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and here's what he told me:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is what is included:         - TCD-D3 DATman.         - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\\\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for           analog output.         - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).         - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The           unit is still under factory warrantee.         - AC adaptor/battery charger.         - Rechargable battery.  I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).  [By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an  extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about  $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5  years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice. Send him mail and ask him what he wants.          Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live album.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          'nuff said.          The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have one.          Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs, by the way.)

God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.

I'm typing this from exactly the same setup. (US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.   Make sure you're using \\\"ssetroot\\\", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an \\\"ssetroot\\\" after tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a \\\"(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&\\\") You can also use \\\"VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename\\\" or just VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.   Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export. All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following: The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized. Even the compose key works.

Anyone have a fix for the last two?  --Dave\",\"prb@access.digex.com (Pat) Pontificated:  What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.    I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in that essentially says \\\"If you never hear from Earth again, here's what to do.\\\"  This was a back up in the event a receiver burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but still some data).    Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might not be such a big loss.

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

The system can be distri-  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video  animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,  and  image  processing  operations.

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.    If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.

What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning \\\"extra-scientific\\\"? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"  Here is an article I found today in comp.security.misc.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the    \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique          2      \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:   --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to       employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;   --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone       calls and data, under proper court or other legal       order, when necessary to protect our citizens;   --   the effective and timely use of the most modern       technology to build the National Information       Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and       the competitiveness of American industry in the global       marketplace; and    --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export       high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.           3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with  no new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on  a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation  encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to  decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a  court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They  would then present documentation of this authorization to  the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and  obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug  smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are  stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key  escrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent  entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the  Administration have yet to determine which agencies will  oversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure  how strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption  systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will  remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow  system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of  cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all  potential users that there are no unrecognized  vulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the  Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in  this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the  President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet  officials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on  encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify  as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have  briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the  decisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access  encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the  microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product  manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip  manufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,  California, and will sell the chip to encryption device  manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed  to other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating  the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological  solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be  willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more  powerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be  considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow  mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product  that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive  than others readily available today, but it is just one  piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to  encryption technology, which the Administration is  developing.   The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption  threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,  we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have  effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every  American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an  unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a  false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is  an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,  and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,  balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper  Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton  Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from  that of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption  technology in telecommunications and computing and are  committed to working with industry and public-interest  groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'  privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law  enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime  and terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use  the government hardware?\",\"I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any real reviews of them.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it.

Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.

I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\" Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling happens in a \\\"compartment\\\" bounded by fascia.

Indeed, it's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance. I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as \\\"accepted uncritically,\\\" especially the few that are legend. Many are trying to explain basic truths, as myths do, but they don't meet the other criterions. Also...   You accuse him of referencing mythology, then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology.  (This time meeting all the requirements of myth.)   Ah, but not everyone \\\"knows\\\" that god exists.  So you have a fallacy.   And that makes it true?  Holding with the Bible rules out controversy? Read the FAQ.  If you've read it, you missed something, so re-read. (Not a bad suggestion for anyone...I re-read it just before this.)   ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn't make it any more credible to me.  If the Bible says that everyone knows, that's clearly reason to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \\\"knows\\\" your alleged god's alleged existance.   1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.  2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.  3) Again, read the FAQ.   Bzzt...wrong answer! Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the other hand, doesn't generally show up in the supermarket, except on the tabloids.  God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence. Gravity is obvious; gods aren't.   No, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of \\\"God\\\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \\\"god\\\". In other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view, human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural tendancy to believe in \\\"God\\\" only exists in religious wishful thinking.   Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions, and it's reasonableness certainly doesn't merit eminence. Divine justice...well, it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity. First, not all atheists believe the same things about human nature. Second, whether most atheists are correct or not, YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity.\",\":  : Once again we are waiting.

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.        The only identification printed on the board is \\\"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\\\" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words \\\"SERIAL NO\\\", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers \\\"1990 2 8\\\".  Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated. \",\"Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and  Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.  I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me. I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,  the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 ) the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits ) and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).

We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a  lot of them got \\\"funny\\\" in the LCD display.  A black stain would spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone).    What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"Hey GUI folks,  Does anyone out there have experience with the HP Interface Architect (GUI dev tool)?

Actually, the words \\\"A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the security of a free state\\\" is a present participle, used as an adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state. In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.    The final word on liberties and rights should not belong \\\"to the many\\\".

Otherwise, a tyrrany of the majority can ensue from \\\"popular\\\" opinion, a concept which you should be familiar with from the Federalist papers.\",\"John Berryhill, Ph.D. writes   umm, please don't lump us all together.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" If \\\"ownership\\\" were rightly based on \\\"worthiness\\\" there wouldn't be any owners. What is your point?

Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was \\\"a beautiful black queen.\\\"  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled \\\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\\"  (The answer to the title is \\\"no\\\"-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the \\\"Black Madonna\\\" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are \\\"white\\\" (i.e., of the racist's \\\"race\\\").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this \\\"Jesus was white\\\" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.\",\"  Phew! That takes a load off.

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,     fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).  Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you  can't really communicate.  Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always screws up the line I've picked out.  Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:  - attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.  - Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not    get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount    in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)  - Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)  - We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many    first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)  - Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and    we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're    confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel    of it.  Or just hug me tight.    - Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be     gradual, so I can compensate.  - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.  - Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right     thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how    to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to    stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to     watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84,     and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \\\"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\\\"     I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with     the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.    Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the    instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her    experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to     trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)  Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes,  tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers. Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.  Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of the guns they conficate were illegally built.   It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to  pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)   Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban  can not be easily side-stepped.   Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely, you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually get it illegally.   Quite.   13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years. Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction in energy (so a .357 magnum would \\\"only\\\" be as deadly as a 9mm) and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and reappear on the streets...)

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

I love it!  Uh, please explain why the smugglers do not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms of communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials when you can bribe them...\\\"I'll give you a hundred grand to let that semi past...\\\"), and firepower.   What's the point here?  You're arguing that the black market WORKS (which it does, of course).     This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would be concerned about value/cubic foot.  Go to a gun show and price out a crate of good quality handguns.     What's \\\"local?\\\"     What is a worthwhile firearm?  Hell, anything that WORKS!

If paying $10 for inconspicuous parts at the local K-Mart is \\\"through the nose.\\\"   Drew\",\" However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka, who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).  Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to- 100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.  I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $40K/year.   Your presumption of \\\"disadvantage\\\" I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.  I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others have seen Browning Hi-Powers...\",\"   That's true. Israeli ID cards do not identify people  as Israelies. Smart huh?     Yes. There's one warhead in my parent's backyard in  Beer Sheva (that's only some 20 miles from Dimona,  you know). Evidence? I saw it!      Yes. But unfortunately I can't give you more details.  That's _secret_, you see.      [...]     You're welcome. Now, let me ask you a few questions, if you  don't mind:   1. Is it true that the Center for Policy Research is a      one-man enterprise?   2. Is it true that your questions are not being asked     bona fide?   3. Is it true that your statement above, \\\"These are indeed      provocative questions but they are asked time and again by     people around me\\\" is not true? \",\"  At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame war, I must disagree.    There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.   As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree 100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  \",\"  Christian  Slater, only gota  cameo on ST6,    and besides.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...

The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \\\"meningococcus\\\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply.

What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.

The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:     o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power.

Even if the situation were not so clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court (\\\"If it really was self-defence,\\\" the prosecuter would ask, \\\"why did you run away and hide from the police?\\\")  In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut: If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of that city's gun control laws.

If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have to:  1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy    water.  2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other    molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids would literally be \\\"heavy\\\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, \\\"better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead.\\\" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.   It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.   Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \\\"the turning point of time\\\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).   The way you refer to it as \\\"doctrine\\\" puts a modern intellectual coloring on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.   Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out. \",\"Help !! - I'm looking for a ISA driver card and driver software for a Logical Devices Husky programmer (It aint mush good without these) can anyone help with either of these items ? cheers Mike. \",\"Are there any Honda groups out there?  Especially ones that deal with Preludes?\",\" I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad\",\"For Sale:  1990 Pontiac Grand Prix SE  White, White rims, Gray interior. 58K miles (mostly highway), 3.8 Litre V6 multi-port fuel-injected engine, 5 speed manual transmission.

One is, \\\"We want you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\\\" or the more straightforward, \\\"This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.\\\"         You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.          Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?         And is writing in support of something automatically \\\"propoganda\\\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe?          If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. (In fact, they both were, because the British government had much greater power than did the American system).                 I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), \\\"Congress has become everybody's city council.\\\"         Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.         It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level.          Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \\\"extraordinary\\\" manner.          I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies.           There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos.          Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and  fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?         Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required?         Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  \\\"I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\\\" (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that \\\"there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.\\\" (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, \\\"there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.

Note the early use of PostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.  -- Eric   Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),  by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff   From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu  Newsgroups: comp.graphics  Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem  Organization: Program of Computer Graphics   I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.  First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon, or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.  Now, the phrasing of this question says \\\"if a line intersects a polygon\\\", so this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.  In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript.  (See \\\"PostScript Language\\\", by Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).  So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P, and then \\\"outputs\\\" the answer.  By \\\"output\\\", we mean the program executes a command called \\\"showpage\\\", which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus the original problem.  There are two small problems with this approach.    (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the  reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of  Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of  Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.   (2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the  PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in  other words, will it halt?   Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a  Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is  undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn  out to be undecidable.   I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite precision and running out of ink, paper or both.  A couple of references might be:  1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.

Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ  The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc. 37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)  --------  From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)  Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative.

Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \\\"effective\\\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.\",\"From what I've seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks in the RA are also in the MOA...

Jimmy\",\" Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \\\"fasad\\\". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book. However, the charge of \\\"fasad\\\" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the \\\"crisis\\\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred.  Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on \\\"fasad\\\" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\",\"      I see one thing wrong with your strategy.

(1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's appropriate.            Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which to punish an individual.          Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?           Virginia.  It passed.           Does it?           Cute analogy.           The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However, we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual. That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.           Huh?\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.\",\"I'm trying to set up a personal studio.  What I'm looking for are a cheap sampler(rack or with keyboard)  or a cheap sound card (AudioMedia I or II or something similar).\",\"  I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after \\\"months of investigation\\\" for their raid.   I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of \\\"9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles\\\". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)  Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died! \",\"  ------------ Part 13 of 14 ------------ MTM(]/3V9F0->7EY>7EZ[N[LJ*GK?W]]'1T>EI:6EI:6E1T='1Z4+I:5'1Z4+ M\\\"V;$Q#&'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'AX>'

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.  You err  if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion. \",\"  If it's any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the color and mono monitors for each are \\\"rated\\\" 1152x900.   Their configuration is the same as yours, so it \\\"should\\\" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT:  I don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However, you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper (located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects and Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. \\\"north-west\\\") quadrant of the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).\",\" This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators. It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air. There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.\",\"Does that mean that they're gonna bring back the Biscayne and Bel Air? \",\" What group is this?

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

Currently, my solution is:      XCreateWindow(...);     XSetWMProperties(..);     XMapWindow(...);     XFlush(...);     XMoveWindow(...);      It works with olwm, but is less than elegant.

You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way.\",\" do not pay $40 for floppy drives.. they are about $40 new. also, you do not need documentation for floppies. installation for these things are idiot proof.  just some advice.. \",\"Greetings from green New Zealand...

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye  stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population  there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately,  the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass  graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed  what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.  The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of  oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot  officials and their violation of the co-founder status of  the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat  engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution  to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked  Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and  only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues  consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories  to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply  was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at  all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which  was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece.  Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish  population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population.  The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their  autonomy in a separate republic.  Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would rather not be involved with the island. But, given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further dissemination of certain types of private information about them.\",\"Is there a Wyse 60 Terminal Emulator or a comms toolbox kit available on the net somewhere?

It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.

I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.   DB... \\\"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage.

You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look at your defense of this later.   Also, the \\\"reward of iniquity\\\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is).   At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.   DB... \\\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\\\"   MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas' death...   _____________________________________________________________________   HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \\\"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\\\" =============================================================   This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event.   _____________________________________________________________________   Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Here's what you said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]...   \\\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.

But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.   Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect.   DB... \\\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:     Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\\\"   MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.   To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \\\"begging the question\\\", if I may quote you.   [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]   DB... \\\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\\\"   MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover.   DB... \\\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\\\"   MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave.

Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \\\"interpretation\\\" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.   You also noted they \\\"interpreted\\\" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember, that's the first criteria we must examine.

[^^^ above, mine] No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.   The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New Testament.   In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \\\"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father's tomb.\\\"             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \\\"hanged himself\\\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \\\"and died\\\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \\\"hang oneself\\\".   DB... \\\"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\\\"   MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \\\"Reputable\\\"?  You mean ones that have never erred? As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^   As I said in an earlier post...   _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria), I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.   MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \\\"went and hanged himself.\\\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \\\"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________   I also wrote...   _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...   Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Let's look at the passage in Matthew:   MAT 27:4 saying, \\\"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\\\" And they said, \\\"What is that to us? You see to it!\\\"   MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.   MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \\\"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\\\"   MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.   MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.   Notice verse 5...\\\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\\\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.   ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \\\"two\\\" accounts of Judas' death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \\\"hanged himself\\\", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.   .......   MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however, highly probable.                            ^^^^^^   DB... \\\"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \\\"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\\\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\\\"   MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some...   _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from).\\\"   MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.   DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \\\"the reward of iniquity\\\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \\\"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\\\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \\\"iniquity,\\\" and then immediately discusses \\\"*the* reward of iniquity,\\\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\\\"   MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!   ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \\\"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \\\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'   Notice that in verse 16, the word \\\"iniquity\\\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \\\"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\\\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \\\"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\\\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?          ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \\\"Buy those things we need for the feast,\\\" or that he should give something to the poor.   So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \\\"wages of iniquity\\\" are.  What do you think, Dave?   DB... \\\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\\\"   MY REPLY... I will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have that big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.  Frank\",\"        Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.         In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.          Most states do not require the registration of cars that are not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do so for tax purposes more than anything else.              Many states do not currently require this, and most, again, only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused  is not required to have insurance.          The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership*.         The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants.

The users key K which can be derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt plaintext M and is then used to form a \\\"three part message\\\".      This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part message is then encrypted by still another key.      My question is: What is a message?      For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block. This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link.      Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the session?      If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.  Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.  The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan. Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court. Cooper conceded that, \\\"You have all these things compressed into a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\\\"  Cooper acknowledged that he carried a \\\"9mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel.\\\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!] Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.  When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.  Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent) had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \\\"If you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong, counselor.\\\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys.  \\\"I'm not going to play games with either counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start acting like professionals.\\\"  Spence told the judge that, \\\"When all the evidence is in, we'll see that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\\\"  Spence continued, \\\"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\\\"  Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated objections would prevent a fair trial, \\\"We can't have a fair trial if the jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm violating court orders.\\\"  Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \\\"preposterous\\\" and denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting.  The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.  Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them. Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that, but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \\\"I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted.\\\"\",\" The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar but Yammie has a TM on the name.

It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.   If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children.     Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.     Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"I guess that makes Altima the most generic car in the US. \",\"Left hand steering wheel placement was not standard until the 20's in the US.

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to control events.  Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results.  Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing  objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there is no room for compromise.

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \\\"virtual screen\\\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.
