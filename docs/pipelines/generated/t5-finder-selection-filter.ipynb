 The United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA) are jointly organising a training course on the applications of satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30 April. The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\" Oh, Your Highness?

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste, has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information.  This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions, the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.  So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first and then ask here.  Instructions:  Short version for techies:  The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \\\"type binary\\\" to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.  I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived.  Long version for non-techies:  In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:   ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu  If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a login:  Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):  Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:   ftp  Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:   Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:  I would enter:   l.v.cipriani@att.com  You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines or similar as output:   Remote system is UNIX.  Using binary mode to transfer files.  Next, the command prompt is printed:   ftp>   If you do not get the line \\\"Using binary mode to transfer files.\\\" Run the command:   type binary  Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are   /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and  /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming  There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.  When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or  cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba  To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command:   cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or  cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming  Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter another command.  To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command:   ls -l  This will produce something like:  total 6021 -r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX -r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies -r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361 -r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu ... and so on ...  Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with.  To get a file run the command \\\"get\\\" followed by the name of the file you want, for example:   get INDEX or  get noduty  After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:   Transfer complete.  19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)  You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive. You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it:   cd congress/103rd  get HR1025  Once you're finished you can log off with the command:   quit  If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different.  First of all you should find out if the file already exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory.  For example:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- File: whitemanslaw  White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985 Reason magazine ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once you are in the incoming directory use the command:   put file_name  In this case:   put whitemanslaw  Again there'll be a \\\"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered in so many seconds\\\" message.  Now your file is on the archive machine.  Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].  Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory.  Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.  If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.  If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so be sure to let me know first.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com     \",\"  And some comments, with some players deleted.   Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the #1 spot.  It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\"How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting?

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've  never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though  presumably it would work by the same mechanism).  Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major pathogen.  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes the \\\"systemic yeast syndrome\\\". \",\"  Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.\",\"    The quick answer:  Revelation 12:7-9   \\\"And there was war in heaven.

As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

Allen\",\"I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently. Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, I guess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for the current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will get an exact byte count.  Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating! If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'. If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes',  not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only 893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say 3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"...and in San Francisco recently, some of our finest examples of humanity poured oil over a road so that vehicles going uphill would suddnely become immobile, and then they would walk right up to the vehicles and make their demands known. --------------------------------+--------------------------------------- Mark Barnes, System Engineer    |  <insert standard disclaimers here> SunSoft                         | Corporate Technical Escalations |  I speak for myself, an individual, Menlo Park, CA, USA             |  not for the company for which I work. barnesm@vavau.Corp.Sun.COM      | --------------------------------+---------------------------------------  \",\"  Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

This column's already full?  And I still have bunches of  commercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start  of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but  I'll have to put them into the next issue.      Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new  happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,  more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on  the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other  interesting developments.     And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and  interesting -- Any and all comments are welcome.  \",\"Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!  As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.    I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2 meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)\",\"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

In Canada, it is almost impossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had an opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because I'm in the wrong time zone!).

If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not visible, the real image virtually disappears!  The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too much!

BMc --\",\"    Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain  things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me.\",\"It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick.  I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.

I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.  The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/ abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when  people started complaining.

You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other than US English.

I don't think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball. McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.\",\"My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our first child (due June 15th).

What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.

Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\"  I have a Bel-966.

To say that something produces only good because it is only good that  it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.

Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\"Just a quick reminder:     The way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).         You are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable. See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.\",\"Hello netters!

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.    It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much  at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that McDonalds makes good hamburgers?

again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).  Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder\",\"Sorry to waste the bandwidth.

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.  Chop Chop  Michael Mule'    \",\"  Noooooooo!

I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.

Come to think of it my brothers Zepher had this as well.  Robert Dilmore dilmore@cray.com\",\" Ok, here's what I understand:  The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:  Honda Civic Toyota Tercel (SL,SL1) Toyota Corolla (SL1,SL2) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323/Protoge' Subaru Loyale/Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth/Dodge Colt   Their core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence \\\"less\\\" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.  I hope this clears things up a bit...... \",\" Never was?  Probably.  Is not now?  Debatable.  What other valid test can you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner?  What do you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  What a joke!   If I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't all that bad a hockey player.  But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:  ??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle- ton, so I'll call this one a +.  Barry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?  Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?  Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender, Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always seems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall as a defensive liability?  Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?  Janney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?  So,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who  else (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes out on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not in spite of him.  BTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet  they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following: Pittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.  In summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be that team that Lindros didn't want to play for.   --  Dan Lyddy    daniell@cory.berkeley.edu    University of California at Berkeley\",\"Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.  Apparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs.   I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels.  If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury.

If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very clear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using.

Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.    Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.  Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs. post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.   Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in, would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet.

In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war.

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack.  Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move.  First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.  Enough for now.\",\"Over the years, I have met Christians who are not associated with any local church and are not members of any local church.

I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.\",\"   I HOPE THAT YOU ARE IN THE WAY OF THE NOBLE FEDERAL ENFORCERS and are blown away accidently by the governments goons.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL. Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another $300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not  to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future. They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a used Ford at a Toyota dealership.  I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.

One example is myself, where no sex->depression :)  But, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline, depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say  depression->promiscuity.  I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and promiscuity is used as an escape. Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of) marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple.  Of course, this is just  my opinion.\",\" And the two simplest refutations are these:  (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.\",\"With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is  squeezed out.

Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for  yourself whether to believe it or not.\\\"  Darren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Darren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of Darren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Darren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, Darren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  Darren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Darren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.  As long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert Becker's paperback, \\\"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason in Lutheran theology,\\\" published by Northwestern Publishing House. This book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago.\",\"[deletia- sig]  [deletia- formalities]  I probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not really intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!  We could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us. But you have not connected denial with disobedience.  ---    - Dan \\\"No Nickname\\\" Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull. Genesis 0:0\",\" I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.\",\"   I think you are suffering from some alignment or color table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast as a Quadra rendering to screen.

And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\"How long has Don Cherry been a student at SFU?

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \\\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\\\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \\\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \\\"outer darkness.\\\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \\\"whosoever will\\\" and the nonelect are the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \\\"Ye would not.\\\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \\\"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\\\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \\\"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\\\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \\\"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\\\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \\\"furnace of fire.\\\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \\\"condemnation.\\\"  \\\"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \\\"outer darkness.\\\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \\\"outer darkness.\\\"  \\\"Outer\\\" -away from God.  \\\"Darkness\\\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \\\"awesome\\\" thought.    \\\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\\\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \\\"I thirst.\\\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \\\"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\\\"  Jack answered by saying, \\\"Yes I think he would!\\\"  Of course the barber said, \\\"What do you mean by that.\\\"  \\\"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\\\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \\\"whosoever wills.\\\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \\\"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\\\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \\\".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\\\"  No, my Bible says that \\\"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\\\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \\\"uni\\\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \\\"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\\\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \\\"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\\\"  \\\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\\"  Don't be one of the \\\"whosoever wont's.\\\"  \",\"Summer Housing needed-at University of Washington, Seattle. ---------------------------------------------------------- Hi           I am looking for a place to stay for the summer  at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I would be  doing an  internship.

If the lemon law had been in place then, that car would have been covered.  I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

If the laws of a land conflict with my religion to such an extent that I am prevented from being allowed to practise my religion then I must  leave the land. So in a way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed to follow the laws of the land that we live in too.  In an Islamic state (one ruled by a Khaliphate) religions other than Islam are allowed to rule by their own religious laws provided they don't affect the genral population and don't come into direct conflict with state  laws, Dhimmis (non-Muslim population) are exempt from most Islamic laws on religion, such as fighting in a Jihad, giving Zakat (alms giving) etc but are given the benefit of these two acts such as Military protection and if they are poor they will receive Zakat.

Ken\",\" Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times \\\"Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period\\\"; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it; that \\\"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\\\" was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre, along with other seaports, \\\"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian and even Chinese trade\\\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by \\\"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line of growth\\\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.    [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.   A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \\\"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\\\"   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?   They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre \\\"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\\\"  The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.   A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian, _Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969). The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument that I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it?

During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"This post has all the earmarks of a form program, where the user types in a nationality or ethnicity and it fills it in in certain places in the story.

One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.  The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \\\"evil\\\" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents \\\"sawed off\\\" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated \\\"good faith\\\" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an \\\"offensive action\\\" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.  The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a \\\"regular supplier\\\").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to \\\"look at the body\\\" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.  Prosecution quote: \\\"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation.\\\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist  Defense quote: \\\"The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.\\\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]  Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including \\\"Tim\\\" again.  \\\"Tim\\\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \\\"ordinary, working class people.\\\"  He also claimed he was for \\\"white pride, not white power.\\\"  Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.  In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \\\"sawed off\\\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!).  Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.  Drew =============================================================  \",\" Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.     I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as scientific work.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Haven't seen this one on here yet, so here it goes:  B. arely A. dequate, T. otally F. ***ed!

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And, after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are, they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes.  They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.  Do you see my point?

Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

Beth\",\"frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer) writes ...  While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\" : >True, man did not invent the need for food, shelter, warmth and the ilk, : >but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass.    : But how do you think property is generated ? Does it grow automatically : on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?  Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case, the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.   :     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not : provide us automatically with our needs,  Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It is not \\\"produced\\\": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.  : There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to  : _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it.  : The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced : it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages : arrange their affairs.  The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \\\"hi'ipoi\\\", the Hawaiian word for \\\"cherish\\\" means \\\"sharing food\\\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called \\\"theft\\\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.  These are the people we call \\\"savages\\\".  On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands      of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.       As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes     through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who     is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going     to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's     suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to     terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case     of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was     this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give     up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your       biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?       A laudable precaution.            Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray     Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an     integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents     that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are     fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The     absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.      In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you      have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable      sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing      but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude      against Israel and the need to vent it.  \",\"Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared worst has happened.

The modem requires a source of 14V AC, but I do not know how to connect the power source to the 3 pin connector.  I know that the top pin is the ground, so I would guess that the other two are the AC pins, right?  If you have any hints, please E-Mail me, I really need help...  Thanks!!!

Mark Guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty.  Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third, with Reboulet as the backup infielder.  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who lead the league in DA in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders (heck, muffing a grounder *I* would probably have gotten to).  Jorgenson did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think* Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.  He looked pretty good there.  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying, he looked reasonable at first.  He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is the Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins 1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  If he hits vaguely like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.  Note:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to pick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.\",\"hi all,  IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing    on SVGA graphics.  COMPLETE:  I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)  Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.  Platform: 386/486 class machine.    800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics   (speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering    purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for    speed reason.)          (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA           cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)  What I'm looking for? 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes    on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.    Presumably in assembly languagine.  Yes, VERY FAST please. 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.    Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of    text, else later.    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule) 2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the     project.  Final remarks;- non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.   Any help is appreciated.  thanks  -Frankie lau@tammy.harvard.edu\",\" I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.  I had to get rid of my \\\"venerable\\\" Bernoulli 20 last year (with enough  cartridges purchased at ~$90 each to make the whole thing  worth more than my whole computer ;).  The tech support guys at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers  might fix the problem - in my case the cartridges wouldn't  format/mount/partition for A/UX.  \",\"To all hardware and firmware gurus:  My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a  physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the \\\"AT     keyboard standard\\\" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time. Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.\",\" <looking around>  Who?  Where? Don't look at me.

Ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the     desktop  * after a short time in NCD's PC X-remote for windows, all characters     displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to   restore without rebooting.  These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts. DOS 5, Win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed.  I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems.  Any ideas?

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned the following  IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or  IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or   IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the MSG)  I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally, and recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than- average rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely single front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do you need?  I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't had a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.

Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and science fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science fiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special interest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a special interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no arguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are not likely to be reading RFT.)

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty.\",\"this must be a FAQ from the very first days of the 13\\\"RGB!!!!\",\": There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at : asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace. : Check the README file.  cant seem to reach the site from over here: \",\"I have heard that there is something called a $25.00 Network that allows two PC's to be networked by joining their serial ports.

To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \\\"paid advertising\\\" but rather \\\"public relations\\\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \\\"advertising\\\" as much as it is \\\"public relations\\\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \\\"public relations\\\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \\\"The Last Action Hero\\\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \\\"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\\\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \\\"commercial launch\\\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL \\\"BILLBOARDS\\\"    Orbital \\\"billboards\\\" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\\".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \\\"Eiffel II\\\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.                                                 (cont)\",\"I just thought I'd share a nice experience before my exam today. I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some \\\"spiritual gifts,\\\" as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon.

There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. Different people are at different levels of development in different areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often  when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher, perhaps blindly.

NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they  are located.  Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?   Thanks in advance          Jouni\",\"Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1?

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by people around me.  1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.

WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE \\\"SPINOFFS\\\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.

Ville Siren's slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.  Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \\\"the Shadow\\\" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting lines:    SWEDEN     FINLAND    35.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the  question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have  not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.     What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my    point in the post, that you \\\"responded to\\\". The point is that since Israel     is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights     to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic     deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.  If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then  tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?     |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others     |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or     |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights.      |> Such as the right to live?

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because    any system can solve it.     The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine).   I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for  all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that  mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your  reply.     Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)     said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:     \\\"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both     peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal       ^^^                  ^^^     of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.     The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of     the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than     to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to     transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be      left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to     absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.\\\"        DAVAR, 29 September, 1967        (\\\"Courtesy\\\" of Marc Afifi)  Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to  getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to  a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to  make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get  something back.      \\\"We\\\" and \\\"our\\\" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which).      Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the     imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !     I think that is fair enough .  No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve  the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction. Guess where that takes your logic?

The blast is believed to be the work of a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement. An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the blast suffered light to moderate injuries.  \",\"     I sold a bike via the net to a young lady who lived in Salt Lake City.

I'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it from someone else.  However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used \\\"speed buffering\\\" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the \\\"speed buffering\\\" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps...

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources  This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The others are entirely optional.  If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \\\"A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community\\\", \\\"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\\\" and \\\"Hints on writing style for Usenet\\\" are particularly relevant.  Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    \\\"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\\\".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    \\\"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\\\" carries a list of these    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \\\"help\\\" and    \\\"send atheism/index\\\".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.    it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. \",\" >This argument sounds very stupid.. if the ability to make guns from  >\\\"simple metalworking\\\" was easy,  then Drug dealers would make their own   >wouldn't they???.. why spend hundreds of dollars buying a gun that  >somebody else made cheap and is selling it to you at an  >exorbitant markup???...

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for  pointing out the parallel. \",\"  (Deletion)   Read a history book, Fred.

Should we name a division or trophy after him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether. Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the  sport itself?      I can't disagree with you here.    What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He originated the phrase \\\"if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat 'em on the ice.\\\"  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance, that Don Cherry is a classy individual?   The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and that is: \\\"it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice\\\"  Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\" I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that comes with the IPX.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following environments:  SUN:   Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them? January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold                1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,                     after cutting off the supply lines to it. Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi. By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from       land links with the rest of the Jewish population.          The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,             while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were             slaughtered, cutting off the villiage. Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from      Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side      of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews       had been killed.  Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking. Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets against Northern israel.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"Has anyone written or seen a C library or C++ class for fixed-point math, or good articles about same?

The structure  of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but  fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have  comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,  in the long term, unless you have the latter.  One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.  HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.

The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).   I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title \\\"Islam and Women\\\", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \\\"I am a Muslim\\\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \\\"following the Qur'an\\\" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.\",\"      Yip, we had the same problem; the only fix we found was to link static some of the clients, ( btw, we used cc). :-(. \",\"       Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators of crimes no more represent the \\\"Black community\\\" than racist hateful Whites represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot!  In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression.

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\" I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car. Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger. Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting.  Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.  I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

Just before arriving at a toll booth I switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction. Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll. I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and usually go to another booth.  My question, is this a good/bad thing to do?  Any others tend to do the same?

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and \\\"marriage\\\" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.          I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?  \",\" I understand and sympathize with your pain.

This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \\\"orbital\\\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")    The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is  itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine's receiver next to it.      If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what  they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with  every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \\\"its chaos!\\\" They  said, \\\"no, its order.\\\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll  play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don't want to be a part of. \",\"With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the American Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I apologize for pointing out the obvious.

I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?      Cheers,      Tom McConnell\",\"     Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will prefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone, rather than:          - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.          - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /           super market.          - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.          - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.          - Using messengers.          - Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like \\\"I had           a blowout on the freeway today\\\".      Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they're being wiretapped, since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication; they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures, since a plethora of simple alternatives are easily available to them.      Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don't think we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs murdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just to steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it catches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the \\\"bad guys\\\" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it, and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it.\",\"(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)  I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ'.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of \\\"pagan goddess\\\" by celebrating Easter.  It is nonsense to say \\\"this word (or this practice) 'really' means so- and-so even though nobody realizes it.\\\"  Words and practices don't mean things, people do.

The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\" You have just reminded me of an old Tom Paxton song...

C.O.Egalon@larc.nasa.gov\",\"Center for Policy Research writes...        Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,     and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence     in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder     and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and     came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move     like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts     of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find      your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than     anti-Israel bigotry.        It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by     residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to     WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of     innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a     racist ommission on your part.        The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is     also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have     been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave     of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the     basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing     but an anti-Israel charade.        Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli     citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials     taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your     stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan     residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as     collaborators.         Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in      How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you     attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of     your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the     racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have        the same bigoted makeup as you?            Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master      race,' for you to avoid...      Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to     seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to     grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the     responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,     Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had     previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved     with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make     Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR     for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved     them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth     is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back     on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of     the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called     Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary     in Lebanon.        Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other     Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of     thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just     because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney     concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an     excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort     to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to     attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons     than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard     Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich      nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight      of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or     your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT     the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is     the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.        Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your     racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a     Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or     had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take     something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do     not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is     to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a      difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You     clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of      the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single     most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it     is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most     evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it     were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast     problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic     manner.        And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is     not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had     taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land     Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS     started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a      completely different set of international laws?  Since you do     continuously refer to international law, would you please say     what specific international laws Israel is violating?                  This attitude      I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.        Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he     wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll     have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort     will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.        Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually     dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what     you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.        Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,     or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an     inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,     what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what     about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the     residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims      in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death     and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk     are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel     has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to      the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The     people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being     killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.     They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept     from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.     And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the     Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your      life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.          Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual     honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself     what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the     belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your     case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe     you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born     a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is     being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a     racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these     fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your      own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be,      it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to      appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other      people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do      some good.\",\"  Yeah I suppose you could do that.

I mean come on!...\",\"    I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX    platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,    or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?    \\\"Motif\\\" includes Xt in this context.  Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.     One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.     Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they    could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!    Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not    yet have the spec)?  Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD  widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port.  \",\"    Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks  moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks.  This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.

Also, my math is frequently noted for being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.  I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes per second is 1.44K.  Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome that problem.)  On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example, you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound, but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical sounds, not speech.  Have fun. \",\"I hear Daigle will eb the first pick next year. What is the word on Kariya??? Anybody ever seen him play on TV????

The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup.

This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key approaches.

Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a \\\"magic\\\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in \\\"chunks\\\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it \\\"fixes\\\".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these \\\"lost chains\\\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked \\\"available\\\" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will \\\"fix\\\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \\\"Missing pieces\\\" are likely to be found in those \\\"lost chains\\\" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\"We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5\\\" floppy drive as the second drive on a Panasonic 286 machine.

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a \\\"Semi-Portable\\\" fashion. By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got \\\"quadra\\\" power at your desk. On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs. Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-) So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical now... \",\"  This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the anti-christ. Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data. What the hell's he gonna do with it?   1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap'. Uh huh.  2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still do have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the Executive Branch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.  3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's not worth all this bloody hassle'   Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there.   The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:   a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XOR arrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been built in to the plan?  b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong encryption?     This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actually wanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenet yelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.   Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away all our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gang of buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\" Not enough magtape.  Seriously, do you have any idea how much traffic flows through the US phone  system in a single day? \",\"  I think the passage you're looking for is the following.  Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\"Hi,  I just got XFree86 running on my pc with Consensys and encountered a few minor (I hope) probems.

Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next \\\"official\\\" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?  One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, \\\"blast\\\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

Peace, \",\" They don't move, to anybody much bigger than an electron :-)  noah\",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\"     Ditto here too...  \",\"The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !    I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a \\\"fake\\\" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

I imagine your library has it or can get it ##for you through interlibrary loan. ##    I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)  ##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre- ##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that ##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by- ##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by ##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that, ##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to ##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the ##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored ##it)?   ##      So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from science.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into your mouth either).      But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.     Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims.  --- Vinayak -------------------------------------------------------                                            vinayak dutt                                    e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu               standard disclaimers apply\",\"This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for', and I ought not to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go, but I would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic.

However,  the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the \\\"truth\\\" and to discern  the bias.   Go read or listen to some Israeli media.

Or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?    Among others, see Olney's  \\\"Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of Animal Studies to Human Safety\\\" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol. vol 6: 455-462.  I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.   Whose talking about \\\"food science\\\"? What is this comment supposed to mean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*, *Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)   Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\" in a few articles. Why don't *you* point us to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.   They're unable to metabolise it.   Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to \\\"sacrifice\\\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.    Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches?

Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\",\" This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe.  Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:  - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)

He called them \\\"the Great Commission\\\" but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:   \\\"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have  to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust  from your feet.\\\"  Matt. 10:15:    \\\"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not    go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with    that town.\\\"   \\\"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.\\\"    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  \\\"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as \\\"ignoring\\\" the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\\\"  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \\\"instruction to spread the word.\\\"  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  \\\"Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\\\"  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  \\\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.\\\"  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  \\\"So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn't take much sophistication to understand.\\\"  On top of which, I doubt that the \\\"answer\\\" is at all representative of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the \\\"sins\\\" of other individuals.\\\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins. That I made public announcements of the \\\"sins\\\" of others --\\\"sins\\\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  \\\"You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to \\\"paint Jews as plaster saints,\\\" thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\\\"  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about \\\"plaster saints\\\",  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.\",\" I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0,  and it works on System7.

An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be \\\"Tek-term\\\") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve  screen space, it stays an icon.   The desired behavior: one of two options -       1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the         inactive one.      2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon        but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher         level than the Xterm.  What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term. These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the  command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence \\\"ESC [ 1 B 7\\\"  would indicate that the \\\"HOME\\\" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as \\\"shift-Return\\\".  If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file \\\"x11term.c\\\".

I'd take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-).\",\"   How about some numbers here?

Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S. 209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite period if intent to return remains.

Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.

However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.   The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.   There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.

I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"Ottawa picks first, because they had fewer wins during the season, the first tiebreaker.  --     Keith Keller    LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

Twenty minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the bike.

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  I'm happy.

I am probably one of those that  think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly  sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of \\\"distractions\\\" for me.        Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault, and I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber. But the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I was too stingy to put on my lights.         The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.        Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 200 million cars, it is miniscule!     Whatever.....  'tis a pity I have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with safety.  -S ssave@ole.cdac.com \",\" -- and --   Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work. People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well.  Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable, reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.    The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors, and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis.\",\"  The VESA standard can be requested from VESA:  VESA  2150 North First Street, Suite 440  San Jose, CA 95131-2029   Ask for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards.  VESA  also defines local bus and other standards.   The VESA standard only addresses ways in which an application  can find out info and capabilities of a specific super VGA  implementation and to control the video mode selection  and video memory access.   You still have to set your own pixels.    VESA defines a \\\"window\\\" that is used to access video memory.  This window is anchored at the spot where you want to write,  and then you can write as far as the window takes you (usually  64K).  Windows have granularities, so you can't just anchor   them anywhere.  Also, some implementations allow two windows.    This is VESA mode 101h.  There is a Set Display Start function  that might be useful for scrolling.    Your best bet is to write VESA for the info.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.  The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.  \",\"  [stuff deleted...]     As I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons.  Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

Top three contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the biggest \\\"cult following\\\", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any tweaking.  The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables & all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...  USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended; it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $190.  All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how it works in two weeks or so. \",\" As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the  pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\",\" [ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from  many Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ]  [ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as it might have been (notable exception: subject headers such as \\\"ONE'S  DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION.\\\" ]  [ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for the religious text than for any \\\"literary/moral analysis\\\" ]  I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're- The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought  that Catholics behaved better than this.  Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice your faith through good example and decent living and respect for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud, insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.  The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it?  Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable,  on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine.  Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s.  I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.  I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of the \\\"I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face\\\" stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

Thomas   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+  \",\": Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business : or professional body in a position to establish a standard and : provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission : systems. :  : RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of : a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones. ....... : Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one, : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.   Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard, and it will become the \\\"market* standard as well. (There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)  (There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will be to make \\\"workalikes\\\" which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)  Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction. Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay. For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me, it's a small price to pay.)  Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces, all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is *NOT* strong crypto!  Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note that I said \\\"potential\\\"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming months).  The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).  I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system.  Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox mode.)  I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of \\\"MailSafe\\\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.  RSA?, Jim?, are you listening?  -Tim May  P.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.\",\"Does anybody have a GIF of the Tiger Stadium seating chart?

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"==============================                               GASPRA ANIMATION                                 March 12, 1993                        ==============================       The Gaspra animation is now available at the Ames Space Archives in  QuickTime format.

As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name:  XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);   and in the eventhandler do a:    while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))    ;   XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);   /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/   However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co    urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin    g wrong? Or is the a wrong approach to this problem? Any hints are highly appreciated.\",\"We have been shipping for over one year the Adobe Display PostScript (DPS) on Silicon Graphics workstations, file servers, and supercomputers.

For more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the   UNIX shell prompt.      passwd - change password     finger - obtain information about a remote user     chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote              users (sometimes `passwd -f')     chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory     umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access              rights     ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories     xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an              Xwindow server     last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their              originations     who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations     w      - list other users and what they are running     xhost  - access control list for X Window client use     xauth  - control X Window server authentication          .signature  - file in the home directory appended to USENET posts     .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts     .Xauthority - file used for X Window server authentication keys     $SIGNATURE  - variable used for name in email and USENET postings    The 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on SMI's   \\\"etherfind\\\" although none of the etherfind code remains.  It was   originally written by Van Jacobson, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,   as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve   tcp and internet gateway performance.  A current version is   available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at   address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.Z (a compressed Unix tar   file). This program is subject to  the 'standard' Berkeley network   software copyright.  _____ <4.2> How can I learn about or use cryptography?    A general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,   especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available   in FAQ form:    >  Compiled by:   >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (Carl Ellison)   >        Gwyn@BRL.MIL (Doug Gwyn)   >        smb@ulysses.att.com (Steven Bellovin)    NIST (U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology)   publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special   publication 800-2 ``Public-Key Cryptograhy'' by James Nechvatal   (April 1991).

To   > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and   > read the file GETTING_ACCESS.    Note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet   and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.  _____ <4.3> What is the cypherpunks mailing list?    Eric Hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list   dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy   in the digital domain.''  Send email to   cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the   list. From the charter:    > The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.   > To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt   > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for   > privacy. Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will   > learn how best to defend it.  _____ <4.4> What are some privacy-related newsgroups?  FAQs?

Balenson     <belenson@tis.com>    Send email to pem-info@tis.com for more information.  See ``RFCs    related to privacy'' for information on how to obtain RFCs.    _____ <4.6> What are other Requests For Comments (RFCs) related to privacy?    RFC-822:  SMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol   RFC-977:  NNTP, Network News Transfer Protocol   RFC-1036: Standard for interchange of network news messages   RFC-1208: Glossary of Networking Terms   RFC-1207: Answers to ``experienced Internet user'' questions   RFC-1206: Answers to ``new Internet user'' questions   RFC-1355: Privacy issues in Network Information center databases       RFC-1177 is ``FYI: Answers to commonly asked ``new internet user''    questions, and includes: basic terminology on the Internet (TCP/IP,   SMTP, FTP), internet  organizations such as IAB (Internet   Activities Board) and IETF  (Internet Enbgineering Task Force), and   a glossary of terms.  Also from ftp.eff.org:   /pub/internet-info/internet.q.    > RFCs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname   > RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT or RFC:RFCnnnn.PS (where `nnnn' refers to the   > number of the RFC).

The first line of the text of the message must be `SEND   > RFCnnnn.TXT-1', where nnnn is replaced by the RFC number.    _____ <4.7> How can I run an anonymous remailer?    Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.

EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.

I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.    previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then     i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows.

I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files  required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows    BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi  and misc.   when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space.

When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.  Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.  When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.     Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  \",\"      Just a question.        As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee       intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes       with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition       for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)  The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers, they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services operated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records. As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, and they generally can confiscate the equipment as \\\"evidence\\\" (which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it. But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys for their own files without giving them to you.  Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew. The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English, and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew, and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they were able to do much about it.  It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.  \",\" [good points on buddhism, etc. deleted]  just because one says christianity -- true christianity -- is hard to follow faithfully does NOT mean that one discounts the validity and difficulty of other religions.  i admire those of any religion who are willing to make the kind of sacrifices and dedicate themselves spiritually in the way you are talking about.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are     using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.       For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results     from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is     being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by     eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students     nationwide.      Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If     drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will     have fewer \\\"drug-using contemporaries\\\" who act as examples of     substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,     one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \\\"must be given     the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\\\"     Johnston says.      This type of resurgence \\\"is possible,\\\" says Eileen Shiff, author of     \\\"Experts Advise Parents\\\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,     she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today     could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.      Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with     drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to     their children.  \\\"I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer\\\" to     their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,     Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \\\"lock-in\\\" party where     no booze or drugs were allowed.  \\\"We need to fulfill that parental     role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\\\" she says.      Officials may \\\"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't     done anything that I've seen,\\\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,     Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and     other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a     member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says \\\"there's always going to be     experimentation\\\" with drugs.      A real war on drugs could be waged \\\"education-wise,\\\" she says.  But     \\\"some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give     them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should     give the kids the information or have it accessible\\\" through classes,     pamphlets and speakers, she says.      Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in     kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,     Fla.  \\\"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think     kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds     (about using drugs),\\\" he says.

Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked.   Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so) and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't  a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and  over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out  of his way.

What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel \\\"puffy\\\", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.  I am under the impression that MSG \\\"enhances\\\" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.  Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is what I suspect as being the cause.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.  Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.

Is this true?  I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no   amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \\\"I will be in you and you will be in me.\\\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good.  How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.\",\"  All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.  Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \\\"DAILY EXPRESS\\\")  \\\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\\\"  Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964    Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.   Date : 1 January, 1964.    IL GIARNO (Italy)    THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.   Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for \\\"connectedness\\\" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept from Hebrews about \\\"not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.\\\"  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon \\\"I am a rock, I am an island...\\\" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of \\\"evil\\\" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\"  I assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip).

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since this is the only other source of information left to us). How can you then convince somebody that your \\\"feelings and experiences\\\" are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and measurable effects?  If my experiences say that \\\"there exists no god\\\" and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal realities.  Furthermore, the trouble with \\\"feelings and experiences\\\" is that they can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I am sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.  Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?   You must be using a definition of \\\"evidence\\\" that I am not familiar with. To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true.  However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith. It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go.   At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously,  the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it should read \\\"for explaining the non-existence of God\\\").  So not only must you \\\"prove\\\" your own case, you have to \\\"disprove\\\" theirs.  (alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)   I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't. I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct me.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the  non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made some progress towards the truth.  \",\"  Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the **VAST** majority of all hardware).     Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about $100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups pertaining to Motif has been high.     I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the \\\"free\\\" UNIX platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.

Murli \",\"# #Slavery makes economic sense (it NEVER makes MORAL sense) when human # #muscle power is an economically valuable asset. Agricultural slavery might # #have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no # #further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during # #the winter.  #  # This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First \\\"agricultural\\\" # slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south # slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all # of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.  And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most  valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying aspect of American slavery.  # Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to # reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's  # the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated # the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the \\\"first # mechanical cotton reaper\\\" was invented.  This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_ (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of cotton farming?  When did this first appear?  # #Ken Mitchell       | The powers not delegated to the United States by the # Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \",\"  Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing  Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For  instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what  really happened.   There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee  Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society,  the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation,  the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek  Men's Lycee Foundation.    As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish'  in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association,  the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been  active until 1984. But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down. This is also the  final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.  In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority  complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye.   The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,'  which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the  three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of  themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'  It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world. The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition, in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091, virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.  The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called'  Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments.   The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region.  And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation,  Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of  Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina.  His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in  24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job.   Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their  findings were published in a report titled    'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'  The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance,  the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention.   The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers.  Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.  It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.  An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there.  Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.  Now wait, there is more.

The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered    to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their    husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age    were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a    captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.     2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.     3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun.     4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls    and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.     5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of.     6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.     The Greeks killed also many Jews.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call.

For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.

Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"What's the feeling about eating and riding?

The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \\\"(at best)  second-hand\\\".   \\\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching   Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and   he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \\\"Saul, Saul,   why are you persecuting Me?\\\"  And he said, \\\"Who art Thou, Lord?\\\"  And   He said, \\\"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\\\"   (Acts 9:3-5, NAS)  Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were  followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.   I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you  the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)   The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \\\"inspired by God\\\",  literally means \\\"God-breathed\\\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words  into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is  one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and  incompleteness of \\\"inspired by God\\\".   That's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a  book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks  of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.    What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings  of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.   Jesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.   Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?  In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.   The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.  About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well.

I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.  The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).      Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

Never attribute to conspiracy what can be explained by forthright greed. \",\" I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"  Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones (BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.

Its letter size (8.5 - 11), brand new in the box and never used. I'm asking $40.00 (bought new at Ballard Computer for $65.95)\",\" Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term \\\"always\\\" is rather deceptive, I admit.      Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?  \",\"_TOO_ many.\",\" ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU (A.J. Teel) writes...

I believed this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!  I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.

In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \\\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\\\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \\\"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\\\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \\\"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\\\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \\\"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\\\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \\\"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \\\"with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even\\\"] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way.\\\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: \\\"In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise.\\\" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: \\\"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?\\\" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: \\\"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture.\\\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: \\\"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\\\" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: \\\"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\\\" (Page 331.)  Limbaugh: \\\"Elements of The Media have jumped on the  bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\\\" (pages 270 and 268.)  *     *     *   To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

Thanks. \",\" I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" Oh, that was just a bet. \",\"Hello.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\" Don't you mean \\\"former motorcyclist?\\\"\",\" I've had exactly the same problems in Aldus Freehand.

An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like \\\"The volcano will erupt tomorrow!\\\"  Don't follow the preacher because of such statements that come true.  Note also, that if I'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say \\\"his mother predicted he would die.\\\"  Of course, his father may have said \\\"he 'll make good money because of his hobby\\\" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \\\"Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\\\" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has come.

In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.
