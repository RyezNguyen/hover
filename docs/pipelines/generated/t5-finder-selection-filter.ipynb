They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key.  Any criminal who's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper.  The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.  I probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext.  An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input.  A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.  You can tell if the NSA built this feature in: blow on the mike, and observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.\",\"Could you explain what any of this pertains to?

It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.  What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.  1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid?  2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.  3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the \\\"right\\\" course of action?

But I still have some reservations.\",\"Actually, I'm still trying to understand the self-justifying rationale behind the recent murder of Ian Feinberg (?) in Gaza. \",\"The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:  I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).  The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the \\\"legs\\\" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's \\\"legs\\\" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors.  Well, that's me.  So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.  Will someone provide the extra 3%?\",\"[... stuff deleted] [more stuff deleted...]  How do you calculate that figure?

So far, Israe  continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they  leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that  the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tim:   There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in  exchange for pieces of paper, \\\"expectations\\\", \\\"hopes\\\", etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that these \\\"tangible concessions\\\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By \\\"tangible\\\" is meant something that 1) provides Israel with \\\"comparable\\\" protection (from the land it is to  give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine  **will be** accountable and held actively (not just \\\"diplomatically)  responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens  or \\\"visitors\\\").  In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**  co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel  from its territory.  Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  how *could* such \\\"guarantees\\\" be instilled? For example,  how could such \\\"guarantees\\\"/\\\"controls\\\" be added to the  Palestinian PISGA proposals?  Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \\\"buffer zone\\\", gives full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would*, if not \\\"controlled\\\" somehow) EASILY return to the  traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen.\",\"David Vergolini writes  Yeah, if the Tigers can keep scoring 20 runs a game.

Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.

What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, \\\"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit\\\" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

Wouldn't that just make AG Reno's day?  \",\"                            ^^^^^^^ Militia                    ^^^^^ State          ^^^^ Arms  You didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA on the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the Constitution.    Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!      James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: \\\"Besides the advantage of     being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost     every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to     which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers     are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of     ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government     of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military     establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are     carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments     are afraid to trust the people with arms.\\\"                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \\\"The right     of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A     well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free     country...\\\"      Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of     the militia): \\\"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with     respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it     will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of     a year.\\\"      Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing     armies): \\\"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the     government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be     formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large     body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****     own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\\\"     ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they said \\\"people\\\", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to \\\"the Right of the Militia\\\"?...  ;-)   You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and probably females under current interpretation).    The Amendment does nor refer to \\\"well organized\\\", it says \\\"well regulated\\\".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how _well regulated_ I am.     Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that was to insure the People could form a \\\"well regulated Militia\\\", not a \\\"well organized militia\\\".   What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set h_bar = C = 1...   Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist Papers?!       James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General     Welfare\\\" clause): \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first     to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a     recital of particulars.\\\"  But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He only wrote it.   That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist Papers.    Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says \\\"well organized militia\\\".    That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any* weapon currently in use in the armed forces.   But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.       Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: \\\"This     country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit     it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,     they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or     their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.\\\"      Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate     over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August     1789: \\\"What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the     establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...     Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of     the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order     to raise an army upon their ruins.\\\"  So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy our Liberties and Rights.  -- Charles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.edu Dept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931\",\"The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the Buick Co. when Durant was there.  When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the \\\"passenger car division\\\" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)\",\"Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a \\\"bad\\\" experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.  Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \\\"Why we never received your old chips.\\\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \\\"You mean you sent them US Mail?\\\" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.) Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to \\\"make it right.\\\"  I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never buy another product from them again.\",\" Steve,      It's nice that you find me laughable but I don't quite understand.  Is it because you think my firearms clash with what I'm wearing, or that my NRA sticker isn't on straight? Please state your judgement!       I find it sad that people won't accept the responsibility to defend themselves.  And I laugh with the same contempt you have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect them.   You and your friends sound like a bunch of smug intellectuals.   Oh,   I guess you are.  I'm still waiting for you all-knowing academic-likes to solve the worlds problems.  Let us know when you have the answers or punch lines as this case may be.   So it's not a \\\"Yankee\\\" thing? Are Canadians actually as uncivilized as we Americans?   Well if it's anything like here it wouldn't matter if they did; they wouldn't be able to use them.   You shouldn't waste your time watching TV, Steve. It will corrupt your mind.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type \\\"archie\\\" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject \\\"help\\\" to \\\"archie\\\" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify \\\"archie\\\" as the host name and \\\"archie\\\" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

There are previewers for xview and sunview,   also on gondwana.  TDDD ---- It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF, Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects. Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid   models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987   For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at   NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325   and the cost is $100.   This standard is not available in electronic format.  c.

I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character  displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless.  I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!!  Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?  Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF? \",\"Cheryl Marks writes  That depends.  Just how much older were they?   \",\"I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer.   I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter \\\"O\\\" there are two outlines:   1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)  2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \\\"polygon with holes\\\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:   1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple   matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for   some fancy fonts).  2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.  Thanks for any pointers.  --> Rob Lansdale \",\"I missed the original post, but aren't the Expos rushing alomost their entire team this year?

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

The argument was  1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game. 2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.  3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12% of defense and pitching is 88% of defense. 4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.  Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and pitching.   I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or even 40-10.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XNOTE: Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->       | X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed. X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->        | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.       | X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts.

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).   Cheers,   Michael \",\" I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was maintained.  I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.   First time I hear about a problem with the valve train on these cars, other than timing belt failures.   If your friend \\\"beats\\\" on the car, then his unit is not a representative sample of the car's reliability.  My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports, talk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach a few of them).   #if (humor_impaired) skip_to TheEnd No matter how much you pay, you won't get all three.  Examples:  NSX:       reliability and looks. Ferrari:   reliability ^H^H^H^H^H^H (yeah, right!) speed and looks  TheEnd -- The opinions stated above are not necessarily my employer's.\",\"      I have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. Khomeini put a  price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.     Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.    The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.   \",\"Is the \\\".3ds\\\" file format for Autodesk's 3D Animation Studio available?  Thanks, Gary\",\"  Apparently not.  In response to his claim that it \\\"terrifies\\\" gay people not to be able to \\\"indoctrinate children to our lifestyle\\\" (or words to that effect), I sent Roger a very calm, carefully-written, detailed letter explaining simply why the BSA policy does, indeed terrify me.  I did not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an answer.  Thus far, I have not received an answer.  I can conclude only that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not worth defending.   In fact, that's exactly the point: people can control their behavior. Because of that fact, there is no need for a blanket ban on homosexuals.

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.    Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.    This \\\"FAQ\\\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.    Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.    This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.      [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     \\\"System Performance Tuning\\\" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the     way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written     comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any     other similar books.  --ed.]  ----------------- Table of Contents -----------------   0. Introduction & Administrivia   1. What about the \\\"Other X FAQ\\\"?   2.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the \\\"Last-modified\\\" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.    If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does   not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can   retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.    There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about   them and how to access them, please see the \\\"Introduction to the   news.answers newsgroup\\\" posting in news.answers.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                         Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.        [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),           Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),           Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.   I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle   non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if   you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]  ------- Clients -------    If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think   carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation    we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult    members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit    of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,    you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule    is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is    incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.  2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were    outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When    questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault    was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were    thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew    you could!  3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,    hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and    referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm    more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not    related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up    some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's    now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by    the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I    was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI    agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say    uncomplimentary.  4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that    the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the    reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing    this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references    to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around    the \\\"He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\\\"    flag.  Sigh.  5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege    reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought    processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button    because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My    only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to    the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to    an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in    the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the    forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In    that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones    Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:    Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and    other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the    BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have    been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?  jsh\",\"What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns.  If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the \\\"swing\\\" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!  Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??        Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line        Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)  * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up    and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,   if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their   checking line against these \\\"finesse\\\" players - well then   let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).  I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.

Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.

Anyone know if that's an option recognized by NYS DMV?  Rod\",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.

One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"?

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

It gives very low gas mileage (something like            11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of            gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).   2.

Thanks,  Dick Detweiler\",\"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]  Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"  Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the  same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system,  and the numbers ended up closer.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\"-*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   Unless one classifies \\\"thinking and informal exploration\\\" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what \\\"science is mainly about.\\\"  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are \\\"mainly about.\\\"  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about \\\"absolute scientific truth.\\\"  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's Rhine.   I think this is absurd.     I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer.\",\"   So now we're judging the Qur'an by what's not in it?

What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which, by the way, I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text, but my ex RCism may be showing - is that, as Benedikt pointed out, Lucifer had perfect nature, yet he had the free will to \\\"choose\\\" evil.  But where did that choice come from?  We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan, but how did Lucifer discover, invent, create, call the action what you will, something that God had not given origin to?  Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.  At least in my mind, salvation and free will are very tightly coupled, but then my theology was Roman Catholic...  Still, how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall?  If Lucifer had perfect nature (did man?) how could he fall?  How could he execute an act that (a) contradicted his nature and (b) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time?\",\"Wanted:  color monitor >= 14\\\"  suitable for use on a Macintosh Centris 610.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.

It seems from the following that the CPSR is atleats starting to question this bogosity:      ---------------------------------------------------------------- April 16, 1993 Washington, DC                 COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC            DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE          Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today called for the public disclosure of technical data underlying the government's newly-announced \\\"Public Encryption Management\\\" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.          According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.          CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called \\\"digital signature standard\\\" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard. NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.          David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  \\\"a step in the right direction.\\\"  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  \\\"At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process.\\\"          CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.

Here are the relevent calls:  main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize  I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.

Thanks a million ...\",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\" I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their \\\"arbitrary but carefully chosen number\\\" is neither.  Additionally, I find their choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why not just use the letters \\\"TIFF\\\"?  (And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word orders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actually don't.)\",\"All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of \\\"sola scriptura\\\" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.\",\" A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens, and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places, is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc... Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public. Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.  The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police, based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially.    I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from \\\"Israeli expansionism\\\". Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire. Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.  With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders, the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible.   Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \\\"center for policy research\\\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \\\"state secrets\\\" after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished. As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact. He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of \\\"Secrets of state\\\", something which every democratic govt has.   I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted, which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill, as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours. This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.   Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such questions are often termed \\\"tabloid journalism\\\" and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity. Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use your own example, these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture.  My answers were not any more \\\"hysterical\\\" than the questions themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative, it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You fall into the same category of those who seek \\\"yes\\\" \\\"no\\\" answers when the real answer is \\\"of sorts\\\". I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness.   Ditto. \",\"   You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel, using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?   I don't think we need to coin a term like \\\"Jedeo-Nazism\\\" to refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the Nazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.   I think \\\"house Jews,\\\" a reference to a person of Jewish ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that condemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  I think a few years free of their anti-Semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.  Adam  Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\"  HEAR HEAR!!!

This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.\",\"OK.

A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and wounding  75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in  Nabatiye. ---   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off  southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command  said.         It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the  motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The army  said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain  guerrillas was not immediately known. ---   Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal  battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled  grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said. ---  Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had  uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said pro- Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.

I also found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the city is defined between 14000 and 24000.

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not like memory is that expensive any more.

The problem occurred when I ejected a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes saying \\\"This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware\\\" even though there was no cartridge in the drive.\",\"...His account that is.  Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The  out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people don't like what he says or thinks.  We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought) in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please. If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But, unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif net police, Ted Frank.   PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.                         ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?                         ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?                           IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?          HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?  I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!    Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that  you may understand this vial act for what it is...  ------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------  Newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal Subject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666 Summary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent! Expires:  Distribution:  Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder Keywords: NWO Ted Frank  Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed. I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding via netmail...)  While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \\\"Argumentum ad silence-your-opponent-um\\\"?! I would have thought he would have wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).  The issue that seems to be: \\\"Is the following an advertisement?\\\" Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...  1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken   *off the net* from last year. If reposting an article  constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post  did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one  had posted the address and subscription price of \\\"Newsweek\\\",  would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff. 2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of  \\\"proof\\\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains  to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  behold, \\\"poof\\\", there goes my account. This one had an  address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!  If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get \\\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\\\" or whatever; they only get \\\"I don't like what that user is doing because...\\\". Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.  In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \\\"Thanks for the info\\\" or \\\"Could you send me such and such?\\\" or \\\"Your posts are very interesting... keep it up.\\\" and only a handfull of \\\"Go aways\\\". But, I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\\\"My name is Ted and and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...\\\") NWO Indeed!  Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy. I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks! Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.  Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction. Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I was just getting started.  It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40 times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed? We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people on the net that are of \\\"interest\\\" to the government, and Ted sure seems to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does he work for? The University of Chicago which he \\\"attends\\\"(?) is well known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...  And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers, kept harping about how they \\\"must have had a different view upstairs\\\" because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally  signalled no goal but the video replay \\\"judges\\\" initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is unheard of.

It does not mean that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss were not.  I agree that this is a \\\"heresy\\\".  So what?   The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.   As far as the \\\"unpardonable sin\\\" whatever that is, it is Biblical, and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same. I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?

I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition Larry posted.  Why did you delete the code that Larry posted?  Also, the Model Penal Code made perfect sense to me.  Were you, perhaps, confused by it?  Also, I am still looking for your definition.  The one you used clearly indicates that a fetus is not a human being.   Circular arguments are usually very consistent.    Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit your needs.

Last week  a banner appeared in the Kingdome:       OLDER WOMEN FOR OMAR   \",\"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.    I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that \\\"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price\\\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called \\\"Security Zone\\\" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called \\\"Security Zone\\\" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.   I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make  Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians. The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an  occupying soldier is attacked.   \",\"   For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very* bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e. stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do with tarrifs being lifted I think).   In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about $5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam projector, but sacrifice portability.\",\"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork.

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.  Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine and we can all live peacefully.  \",\"If you are interested in (any of) the following, please contact me:         EMail           mbeck@vtssi.vt.edu         Phone           (703)552-4381         USMail          Michael Beck                         1200 Progress Street #5500E                         Blacksburg, Virginia 24060 ~~~~~~~~~~FOR SALE as of 12AM 4/16/93~~~~~~~~~~   1       PANASONIC AF X8 CCD OmniMovie Camcorder                 VHS HQ                 High Speed Shutter                 Flying Erase Head                 ca. 3 years old, but only used VERY lightly                 Date/Time stamp                 Counter/Memory                 Rec Review                 Fade                 Back Light                 Auto/Manual Focus                 Built in microphone/Jack for external microphone                 Comes with:                         Sturdy aluminum/hardplastic carrying case                                 (20\\\" long X 13\\\" wide X 6\\\" high)                         Shoulder strap                         Power adaptor/battery charger                         Battery pack                         Remote recording controller                         UHF/VHF ---> cable adaptor                         Audio/Video cables and adaptor                 Aproximate dimensions (measured around outmost features)                         15\\\" long X 4\\\" wide X 8\\\" high (w/ handle)                 ASKING PRICE:  $BEST OFFER  ($700 new price)   1       AMIGA 3000UX    25mhz, unix compatible machine w/100 meg Hard                 Drive, 4 meg RAM, no monitor, keyboard (ESC and ~ keys                  broken)                 ASKING PRICE:   $1500 OBO.   mult.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

It was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.   The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k miles, a rare screw up by Honda. Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR. \",\"   In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G range.   True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the risks involved.  If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures 100% of the available launch market, then I think you could do it.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"Boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ:  Given 4 points (non coplanar), how does one find the sphere, that is, center and radius, exactly fitting those points?

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.

The primary purpose of a professor # |## at a university is to publish.  Teaching is secondary.  The summer # |## is when professors are able to do the research required for their # |## papers. # |# # |#I'm told by my advisor that only at some universities is publishing # |#the primary emphasis; many professors in the Cal State University # |#system don't publish at all.

I believe that Cal State schools # do not.  I call them colleges.  UC schools are universities.  At a univeristy # the number one goal is to publish.  Cal State University system offers bachlors and masters degrees.  The Ph.D. is not offered, because of opposition from UC.  # At the Cal State schools, do the professors you speak of have PhDs?  At  Nearly all the professors have PhDs.  I haven't had a professor who didn't, though my wife has had a couple of professors with just an M.A.  A friend had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway. He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him to show up to teach.  # a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants (TAs). # TAs were the slave labor, graduate students who got their tuition paid, and # a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt # work.  The professors taught the lectures, with 100 to 500 students per class, # then the TAs taught the labs, with 20 to 30 per class. #  # Tim Fogarty (FOGARTY@SIR-C.JPL.NASA.GOV)  At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\"   Why \\\"must\\\"?  ---           \\\" Whatever promises that have been made can than be broken. \\\"\",\" I've read estimates that Pol Pot killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 million.

Tom Nguen\",\":  (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the   original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.  Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion  and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.   \",\"Nikon FM-2n with 50 mm Nikkor and accessories for sale.I bought this camera in Hong Kong two years ago and everything has been looked after very well.

Thnx in advance, Manu Das\",\"This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)  Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  The majority of the discussion involving this \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret? :-)\",\"     I love it, I love it, I love it!! Wish I could fit all that into a .sig file! (If someone is keeping a list of Bobby quotes, be sure to include this one!)    The Flat-Earthers state that \\\"the Earth is flat\\\" is a fact. I don't accept this, I think it's an unproven opinion, and I think the Round-Earthers are right because they have better evidence than the Flat-Earthers do.  Although I can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to support a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and I'm not going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a reason to believe in a god that I absolutely can't ignore.  A while ago, I read an interesting book by a fellow called Von Daenicken, in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he wrote something like \\\"Can you prove it isn't so?\\\" I certainly can't, but I'm not going to believe him, because he based his \\\"proof\\\" on some really questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it \\\"circumstancial evidence\\\" :] ).

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.    Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:         a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:   Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)  Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)  Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour  Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km  Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC\",\"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. \",\" First, off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

For his own sake, I pray that Dan does take it literally because that's how God intended it to be taken.  Dan, your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view. However, I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.  I have no clue where wwc is, but please mail me.  I'd really like to get you in touch with them.  [insert deletion of ranting about other religions which obviously has gone off-center of Dan's original context]  Dan, I'm familiar with this one.  You've got a point, though.  There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly don't have an answer to this.  [insert deletion]   My parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do with it.  As for these attacking responses, I must say that I disagree with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements (possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what they do.  Please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with what is being discussed.

But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \\\"sabbaton\\\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\\\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because \\\"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\\\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?\",\"  Boy, Travis..

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts  \",\" But remember that had God extinguished the blasphemous trash of Europe (and Imperialism with it), the United States would not exist today to put an end to those \\\"games\\\"....begs the question, which came first, the chicken or the egg???\",\"PC Mag only got around 9-10 Winmarks when they tested the Steal 24.

Even worse, if the phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot.

Comments   are invited. - Paul )  In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies.  I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however, that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.  As a private citizen, I would feel much more \\\"secure in my person and papers\\\" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or overtly controlled by the government.  Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned, I have the following comments:   - SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have         great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_  information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's        likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly   *wrongful* disclosure.   - GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of   their fidelity and ability.   - *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF  to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a   better choice.  Ever since last fall's \\\"trial balloon\\\" was posted in sci.crypt, your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.

Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.  Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.  Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State, Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar.  Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \\\"all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- two (62) years...\\\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion of this \\\"para-constitutional\\\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force.  Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other  States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia.  In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.   It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.   Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or \\\"train bands\\\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years, and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever, \\\"terrible and irresistible\\\".  These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.  The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the  Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were \\\"grandfathered\\\". At least one of these \\\"grandfathered\\\" individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts.  Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a \\\"well organized\\\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of \\\"well organized\\\". In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not be so bold.  Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution.   Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The Constitution prohibits States from keeping \\\"Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace\\\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. Today we call any large vessel a \\\"ship\\\" but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel.  A \\\"ship\\\" is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \\\"brig\\\" has two masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. \\\"Troops\\\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.   In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.\",\"Sure I'll give you 10 bucks for all of them \",\"      I agree.

And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).

Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he  could pinch hit if they needed him to.  I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the   doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that  he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his  speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely  confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that  particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?  Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing  but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play   Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.  Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm  going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's  got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -   coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign   in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.    It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin   was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.    BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third   and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the   replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a   serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year   and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan !  (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\" Dean, there's an old engineering saying concerning inventions and wheels.

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).

In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.

It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed.

Thanks for your help,  Dave Arndt St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church St. Peter, MN 56082\",\" There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year. The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \\\"self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\\\" is probably well under 250 per year.   Handguns designs have included a \\\"hammer block\\\" since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or  in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)    I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders  each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only 2.1% of the murders were killings by \\\"wacko\\\"s, you would be wrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated assaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and  preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the accidents you are worried about.

I declined to participate.  Last year at the liturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but to no avail.      As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \\\"try something new\\\" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (\\\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\\\" according to one of our priests) the congregation was \\\"invited\\\" to come up and help wash one another's hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \\\"Body of Christ\\\" -- \\\"Amen\\\" for receiving Communion), that they could be \\\"I am not responsible for the blood of this man.\\\"     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\\\"Blessed are You, God of all creation...\\\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).      The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be \\\"liturgically\\\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be \\\"creative\\\" who are not.

Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.)\",\"Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x,y positions are known.    Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click the mouse.  Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values.  This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process, scanner errors and what have you.  The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so \\\"global\\\" adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.  So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of points   Reference(x,y) (the known true values)  DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)  DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)  what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors.  I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a \\\"bumpy\\\" 3d surface, solving for the surface and then \\\"flattening\\\" it to remove the errors in the other data points.  Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet, pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to have \\\"a positive view\\\" of one's self.  This of course, is foolish.  Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a \\\"positive view\\\" of themselves?  Of course not.  A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn, and IF you believe in the concept of \\\"society\\\", then your only choice is to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.   --  There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster.

I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder after about two blocks.  I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a post in an underground parking garage.  Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on me bike.  When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.  By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much and the inner tubes were free.  Later. \",\"  No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact the authorities!

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.  Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...

Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.  When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions,  explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. (I promise I am not making this up!)  I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any  headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed  laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets.  \",\" Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications, near Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-)) and a lifetime warranty.

What's entropy?   * In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?    A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a   decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of   functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of   ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the   decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that   D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption   of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key   (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext   into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to   encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.  * What is an attack?    In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method   of starting with some information about plaintexts and their   corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out   more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state   mathematically what this means. Here we go.    Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,   and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.    An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an   algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that   there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have   f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this   probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).    The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at   least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and   g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible   ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other   words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions   E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).    An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if   n = 2, and so on.  * What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?    In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.   Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this   property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem   is strong!''    In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely   formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is   strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against   all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as   defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this   statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist   any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement   to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that   the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.    Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical   definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions   we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can   figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used   properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.    The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst   can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to   construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,   and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.    * Why is the one-time pad secure?    By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the   plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)   of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive   or) of K and P.    It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial   single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform   distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform   distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,   i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,   with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and   g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of   K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also   be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is   uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p   that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus   a fortiori A is trivial.)    On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used   for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial   multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be   thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';   this explains the name ``one-time pad.''  * What's a ciphertext-only attack?    In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is   constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about   n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some   information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial   if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given   G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.    For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can   easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply   guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use   the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no   matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which   produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.   If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is   a nontrivial attack.  * What's a known-plaintext attack?    The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,   G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.   In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption   P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the   other decryption P_2.    Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature   as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the   cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him   decrypt further messages.  * What's a chosen-plaintext attack?    A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical   series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the   cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into   our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a   chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and   look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured   out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of   attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''    A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption   attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a   way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.    There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:   for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as   T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew   for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash   function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.  * In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?    Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some   plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're   also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find   K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).    If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed   on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results   only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial   attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many   possible keys.  * What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?    Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys   randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to   for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which   are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English   words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much   faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\",\"PSA 145:9  The LORD is good to all: and his  tender  mercies  are over all his works.\",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"  With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.\",\"I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say \\\"what does he know? He's from California.\\\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.    Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \\\"inner city\\\" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town. Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.  \",\"Hi, I'm just getting into PoVRay and I was wondering if there is a graphic package that outputs .POV files.

Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.   Get Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.  The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches who are interested in \\\"rope-a-dope\\\" strategies.  If you want the Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and get a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks from a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players like Kovalev.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.

However, they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such, and not an entirely different source.       We are talking date of texts here, not the age of the authors. The usual explanation for the time order of Mark, Matthew and Luke does not consider their respective ages. It says Matthew has read the text of Mark, and Luke that of Matthew (and probably that of Mark).   As it is assumed that John knew the content of Luke's text. The evidence for that is not overwhelming, admittedly.       When they are from about 200, why do they shed doubt on the order on putting John after the rest of the three?       Sure, an original together with Id card of sender and receiver would be fine. So what's that supposed to say? Am I missing something?       That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.   The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?   One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and  idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A  short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda  and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious  for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their  neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely  within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to  x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is  the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary  heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous,  even lunatic.   And we still demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide  and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian  political pressure.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.

ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.      The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.     Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and feared dead.     The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\\\" That's when the real  slaughter began,\\\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. \\\"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\\\"     \\\" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\\\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.     One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.      The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately, were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their wounds or the cold.     By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.     Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)  I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After all, that's what I do, too!

They will recound the many public places that they had to bring to court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights on their books as we now speak.  That is another good reason to donate to their legislative fund. ____________________________________________________________________________    Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]   \\\"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November  3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In  the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley  makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them  ('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently  sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven  personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the  substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive   those studies are.   Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to  a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order  to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,  a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as  in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT  make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on  humans but on rabbits.   One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist  Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that  a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get   headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably   overemphasized the extent of the problem.'   A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor  at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley  remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory  animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because  it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's  research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human  youngsters.   In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's   experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected  extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing   their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,  and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance  to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither  of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG   with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by  enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little  reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human  blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations  found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....   The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of  that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific  Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,  have concluded that MSG is safe.   Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never  been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed  to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a  burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe  of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently  exonerated the much-maligned substance.   That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of  monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever  we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one  of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken  down into glutamate during digestion.   It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the  most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes  up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in  milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.   That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number  of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore  sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international  professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus  reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.\\\" \",\"This may be an FAQ, but I dont know where to get the FAQ list!

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"I have a Sega Genesis (barely used) that IUd like to sell with the following games:  Sonic the Hedgehog (I) Revenge of Shinobi Thunderforce III  I'm asking $160 OBO.

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"   As I recall, in the 60's the Kennedy Administration had sub-kiloton nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed.

Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique I'd never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me are:  1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens), I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, don't know about the others.\",\" CONGRAULATIONS !!!! Your helmet just passed the Snell Test.    Oh well, as least it looks ok now.

His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War.  In 1936, for example, O.

In the German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg 49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%. So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of German voters.  Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties. Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed Chancellor.  What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.  Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis. If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had begun to decline.  Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher, who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others, knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together.  Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:     The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their    failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,    in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of    the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their    opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine    against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm    them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.  True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him *before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties (Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis. Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over. \",\"    Annoying???

It is taking about 4 mins per image to compress, on a 25Mhz 486 but decompression is almost real time on a 386 in software  alone. \",\"--  Thanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom.   As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was a little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They said that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low  numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked great.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great!  It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.   I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those  who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.   ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should be road legal tomorrow.

I haven't tried it with JPEGs, but I do realize how agonizingly slow it is with GIF files.  \",\" I have used both version 1.17 drivers for Win 3.1 and the new 2.03 drivers. I have had none of these problems.  No GPF's at all.  I have a feeling that your problems are not with the card or drivers.  The ATI Ultra drivers are considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones  seem quite good as well.  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in your Gateway.  I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them have found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.  The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/ abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when  people started complaining.  I still only have one small problem with them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/ reads to the swap file.  \",\" While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \\\"fun\\\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \\\"ok\\\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \\\"stuck\\\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \\\"better\\\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \\\"pouch\\\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.  Nathan nathan@sco.com   \",\" You can change it.

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:     Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)     Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.  and when all else fails,      Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors      already allocated in the colormap.  This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and  no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has  already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens  of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Very few guns were turned in. The news tried to hype it but  when the best they could do was \\\".... including a loaded .38...\\\" well, you get the picture.  A side note- the news also reported that the guns would be checked for whether or not they were stolen. STOLEN GUNS WILL BE RETURNED TO THEIR OWNERS!!!!! (They say)  (Does this have anything to do with the rally on the Capital steps yesterday  in support of the RKBA????)  Even the rally made the 5 pm news on 3 channels :-) \",\"  My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.    If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings.\",\"Well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative  posting.     The question i have about the proton, is  could it be  handled at one of KSC's spare pads, without major  malfunction,  or could it be handled at kourou  or Vandenberg?     Now if it uses storables,  then  how long would it take for the russians to equip something at cape york?  If  Proton were launched from a western site,  how would it compare to the T4/centaur?   As i see it, it should lift  very close to the T4.\",\"      I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable.      I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the  Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion  does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion  that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However,  I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were* it well founded.    Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal  act according to Islamic law.

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \\\"no way!\\\"  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?   Are any brands \\\"quieter\\\" than others?\",\"  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry \\\"average\\\", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.  (And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to \\\"abandon\\\" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)\",\"  If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.   The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly from the hardware port.

DS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed. Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.  And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock speed as is the 68030. \",\"   While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their relief staff may be suspect.

Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is  unlikely to self-destruct.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.  Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server bug?

Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies : from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and : which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). : eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris : 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are  used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier).  I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to \\\"existing, unused\\\" drive letters.

We are now mapping the human genome.  We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no \\\"hybrids\\\", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out \\\"garbage genes.\\\" This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's. But if we could make \\\"philosopher-kings\\\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before \\\"1984.\\\"      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \\\"garbage\\\" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded \\\"garbage\\\" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.\",\" Erickson did go on the 15 day DL with a pulled muscle in his left side (near  rib cage).

Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.   This happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)

I can drive an 18-wheel truck with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this. Again, personal rights versus collective security.    Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.    Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost \\\"in a crowd of one\\\" than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.

Precisely why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.    Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note that our own state governments often play with game with the federal government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.    It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.    We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.    They are neither.  They are an option.

This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

What am I missing?\",\" [Stuff deleted]     Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a \\\"work\\\" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.  OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.    Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices).  Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently orienting the entire surface.  Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point, calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations (mark them CLOCKWISE).  If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face and go through the algorithm again.  At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found.  (Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.

I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again.  Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.  If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will make it happen and provide you with the details.  BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system.  This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new information.

When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when I was a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only  gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with  food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.  Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,  used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed  by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to  police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,  sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.           \\\"Torture in Greece: Hidden Reality\\\"  Case 1: Kostas Andreadis and Dimitris Voglis.  ...Andreadis' head was covered with a hood and he was tortured by falanga (beating on the soles of the feet), electric shocks, and was threatened with being thrown out of the window.

The Israeli  secret service,        Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant        information in connection  with the camps set  up in the        Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of        militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for        the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \\\"extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\\\"  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the \\\"American Horror File\\\": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.  The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors.  This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.

The service techs I talked to said, \\\"Oh sure, we stock those.\\\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

They advertise these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the 5.25\\\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try and make it apply to events 20 centuries later. \",\"  Please note that there are some radiosity packages in my Resource Listing (under the Subject 3: FTP list)  Greetings, Nick. -- Nick (Nikolaos) Fotis         National Technical Univ. of Athens, Greece HOME: 16 Esperidon St.,       InterNet : nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr       Halandri, GR - 152 32   UUCP:    mcsun!ariadne!theseas!nfotis       Athens, GREECE          FAX: (+30 1) 77 84 578  USENET Editor of comp.graphics Resource Listing and soc.culture.greece FAQ NTUA/UA ACM Student Chapter Chair - we're organizing a small conference         in Comp.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is public-key cryptography? * What's RSA? * Is RSA secure? * How fast can people factor numbers? * What about other public-key cryptosystems?   * What is public-key cryptography?    In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and   decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext   P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some   ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so   that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed   from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.   That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie   and Hellman in 1976.    In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to   send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than   them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,   and you don't have to worry about spies.    This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an   extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,   applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the   mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.  * What's RSA?    RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and   Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at   RSA.COM. Here's a small example.    Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples   (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,   and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We   define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.    Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as   anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair   (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a   secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.  * Is RSA secure?    Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.   See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization   algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to   prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that   matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by   ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,   ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to   prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and   theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative   results.''  * How fast can people factor numbers?    It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra   and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three   weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;   each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The   algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a   bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers   n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in   any case.    An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple   polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n   log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,   but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100   and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.    Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few   years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are   developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from   factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number   field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic   sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)  * What about other public-key cryptosystems?\",\"-| I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz -| 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking. #                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^  By \\\"they,\\\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???  It didn't \\\"splinter\\\" from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  #>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J.

I am not comfortable with this alleged \\\"cosiness\\\" with Mammon: I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \\\"orders\\\" (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX \\\"Peace Keeper\\\" missile maze in Utah).  #        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have #splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small #and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry. # #        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.

The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the \\\"proof\\\", this does not  satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.   Are you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question \\\"Does God exist?\\\" i.e. self-awareness and reason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?  You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".

Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"   Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for \\\"cheap\\\", but I cannot get the source for \\\"cheap\\\", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \\\"free\\\", doesn't it?      Cheers,      Tom McConnell\",\"Woof woof! \",\"   This posts contains too many fallacies to respond too.   1) The abolishment of divinity requires the elimination of  freewill.    You have not shown this. You have not even attempted to. However, the existance of an Omniscience being does eliminate freewill in mortals.*   * Posted over five months ago. No one has been able to refute it,  nor give any reasonable reasons against it.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.           They do what god tells them to do. \\\"\",\"    I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these acts is blasphemy against God.  God caused a bush to burn without being consumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role?     Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically removing the physical \\\"proofs\\\" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase science is removing our props.  I don't think this is a bad thing.\",\" I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to  irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.  I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.  The number of people who participate in \\\"victimless\\\" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"  Because, the x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide  of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the  fruits of that genocide.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.   A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold.

The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:     o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes          requires several attempts.  QUESTIONS:     1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?    2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard       SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?    3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest       and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the       end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx       terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal       drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with       one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).       I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;       so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue.

None of this sounds like a \\\"small fishing village\\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \\\"opulent and flourishing bazaars\\\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was \\\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\\\" During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \\\"other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and Zahlah.\\\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984, \\\"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.\\\"  If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present, why is it always called a city (or, above, a \\\"major city\\\")?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says \\\"Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.\\\"   Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also, so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.      I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS   The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.   The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.   \\\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\\\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. \\\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\\\"   In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.   \\\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\\\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.   While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.   \\\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\\\" Heflin said.  \\\"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.\\\"   Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training \\\"runs\\\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.   Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.   Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.   Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.   Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.   The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.\",\"it can   position.    now, but   please    Sunny,  I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on  it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I  trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the  least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a  horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data  integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you  have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on  it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I  don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S  internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.\",\"Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.

I am hoping that the arrival of (1) Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY* she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(  Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies.      Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as  a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.  They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet,  whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and  wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers. First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got it.  After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that. Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.  Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                   The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he  \\\"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out. His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise David Koresh.\\\"  Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.  Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?  I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing.  That was the start of the \\\"Justification\\\" part part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.  But, back to the plan.  It is considered \\\"Cruel and Unusal Punishment\\\" to execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.  They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the  compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.  I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR (Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical  agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.  I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.  We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these people 51 days.    I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:  \\\"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.\\\"  It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.  One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises.                                                                 HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!  THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!  Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him. For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy! I hope he gets it.                               \",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\" All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends. Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more \\\"safe\\\"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with a \\\"traditional\\\" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.\",\"You have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in Windows than in DOS - regardless of what communication software you are using.  Try the following:    1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.     2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)        can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can        buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.

Box 171194            Holladay, UT 84117-1194\",\"    Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice. In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't and wouldn't play a lick of defense.  It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldn't matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

Maintaining a `just  friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.  Now wait, there is more.  Source: \\\"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\\\" by Avetis Aharonian.

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that.  Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory. All 20 of them!\",\"-*-----  I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?    It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered legitimate hypotheses.

Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown     by the Graphite and #9GXE's \\\"cheating\\\".  Can't they just admit that     their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach     is much harder to beat...  2.  The big \\\"cheat\\\" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and     PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't     do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing     PC Magazine says is that scores are not \\\"legitimate\\\" -- couldn't they     at least make some comment about its real-world performance?  I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx      \\\"Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world      applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than      any other display adapter in the industry.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

He stressed how likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He was concerned with the safety of the children.   What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?   What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible. They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh.   Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks.   It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid.   Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.   If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today. Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.  Incompetent law enforcement can kill you!   \",\"Discounts!

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of    September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively    addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security    Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all    unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There    have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages    in Bosnia have been bombed.      In response to these violations, the Security Council decided,    in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all    unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize    Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-   zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.     NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air    enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General    was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY    FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating    allies.      The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my    direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to    all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct    of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by    the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces    initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and    12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.     These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m.    e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for    combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.      NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air    patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early    Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally    operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the    Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching    the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted,    escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these    steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such    aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by    NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved                                     more                                              (OVER)                                     2      rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will    be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations    Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was    consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully    considered before the rules of engagement were approved.      It is not possible to predict at this time how long such    operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces    to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional    authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-   tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and    I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward    toward attainment of our goals in this region.                            Sincerely,                                     WILLIAM J. CLINTON         \",\"   Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did  Alomar have?

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points higher in both leagues than any other year.  Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.  Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin Mitchell :->.  The other elite fielders in the league.  This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average. His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  Add another to the elite fielders list.  Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low 1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988 (best year ever) brings his average up a lot.  Strange last two years.  According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base. But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).  Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.  Last year -- a fluke or a portent?  Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?  Brook  is declining.  Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder at third.  Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about 10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.  Moving back to second was a good idea.  So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.  Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit, HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.  Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.  Not a good fielder.  Both are better off at shortstop.  Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to have helped his fielding any.    Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean. --  Dale J.

But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next  season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg  and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for  personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind  of money they would receive in NHL.

(1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W     : crater diameter in km   g  p  f  n          (1/6)     S = (g /g )      : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g   e  t        Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface          e        t          gravity of the target body. This scaling is          cited for lunar craters and may hold true for          other bodies.    (1/3.4)     S = (p / p )     : correction factor for target density p  ,      p   a   t           t          p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U           a          crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average          rock on the continental shields.      C       : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km          in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).             (1/3.4)     K       : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)      n         empirically determined from the Jangle U          nuclear test crater.         3     2         19     W = pi * d * delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )        : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent          given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile          density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3          g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.      An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing     asteroids.      Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.      More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):      Asteroid     Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy     diameter (km)         (impacts/year)    (* 5*10^20 ergs)       10       10       10^-8  10^9       1    1 000       10^-6  10^6       0.1        100 000       10^-4  10^3      assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT     equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.      References:      Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyder's USGS publication \\\"Map Projections--A Working Manual\\\", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     \\\"An Album of Map Projections\\\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways.

What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\"Can someone please help me understand the current situation regarding SIMMS?

Rob\",\"  One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).  May we all experience and accept God's grace.   =============================================================================== Paul Conditt  Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu Applied Research Phone:   (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259   Laboratories  Fedex:   10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423 University of Texas Postal:   P.O.

Giving the man $40 million to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the safety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off before somebody is wise enough to take it away.   I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had 73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.  Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth. But I think third or fourth place is more likely.\",\" In some South American countries, after political undesirables disappeared, the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal of the body.

I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\"I keep finding these programmers in local junk shops.

Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article:                             NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                  A 3RD OPINION                           ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )             DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources            that have shown themselves to be reliable.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

And, much as it discomforts us, in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do. Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea: my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great- grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota, contain quite a few gravestones like \\\"Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and baby, May 6, 1853.\\\"   More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.   It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.  Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.     My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.  We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks. I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting until an emergency to give in.  And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions. We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main decisions were really hers.   I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that a first-time mother should have her baby at home.   But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings. In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all, an esthetic consideration.\",\" Ok boys and girls,  \\\"What was the 'Ogadan War'????\\\"  The Money Raised in Band-Aid covered How Much of the Cost of Which Soviet Client State to replace what catagory of weapon system lost in the aforementioned war?
