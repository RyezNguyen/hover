Please inquire to the phone number and address listed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------  \\\"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier\\\" Sponsored by the Planetary Studies Foundation  The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for teachers called \\\"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier.\\\" The class will be held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning Center at (708) 359-7913.

(It's \\\"Kirlian\\\".  \\\"Krillean\\\" pictures are portraits of tiny shrimp. :)  [...]   I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at 0 degrees Kelvin will have its own \\\"energy signature\\\" -- the interesting questions are what kind of energy, and what it signifies.  I'd check places like Edmund Scientific (are they still in business?) -- or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere in the relcom.* hierarchy.  Some expansion on Kirlian photography:  From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide To Natural Therapies_, ISBN 0-14-008561-0, New York: Viking Penguin, 1986, p211, p188.  A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.    [...]    Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer   has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...   From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \\\"Reality shopping; a consumer's guide to new age hokum.\\\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986, vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The   variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious \\\"auras\\\" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown. \",\" are you serious? pitchers are pinch-hit for in the nl.  they are not in the nl.  if a pitcher is cranking in the al, he will stay in the game.  if he is cranking in the nl, he may not - ESPECIALLY if it's a pitchers' duel, and his team needs an extra run.\",\" I think you meant Quadra 800 .....

However, I agree that it's quite the sneaky trick.  No more than I would expect, however. -- \",\"  Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )     Alex.  \",\" Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range. How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget allows, the Land Cruiser?  Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road. Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the on-road comfort.

I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.\",\"      And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian troops controlling the country.  Until Syria leaves, and free elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the Lebanese would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.    I expect you will agree that the same holds true for Syria having no right to be in Lebanon?     The UN also thought Zionism is racism.  That fails to make it true.    They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.   They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are usually picked up in the morning.

In addition, the icon that you are dragging will show a \\\"+\\\" while you are holding the Ctrl key, indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved. \",\"  There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.  When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc., it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.  The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for example.

Yes folks, I realize I have stuck my foot in my mouth quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications.  My inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge.  Thanks to you kind (and some not so kind) people I am learning.   Some people have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong. In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to further the anti-gun cause.  I have said several times before (but nobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control.  As far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one thing to say - I am in no way prejudiced.  Some of the things I have stated were said to demonstrate that I am not prejudiced and/or a racist but I have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced.  I will not say anymore about that subject because no matter what I say it will be the wrong thing.  Boy, what a start to being on a new group.  Oh well, things have been worse in my life.

By for now,\",\" Is there a precompiled version of hp2xx for DOS out there - prefereably for 386/486? \",\" Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.  First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

During the season, he was probably more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he *was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more than *because of* him.   Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago, where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure of better. The concept is called \\\"context\\\", and you should really become familiar with it someday.   Unless this transaltes to \\\"Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to the Jays,\\\" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.   What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \\\"won\\\" 68% of the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?   Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.   No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow \\\"learn how to win\\\" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation.

Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense, each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.  The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \\\"evil\\\" federal government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents \\\"sawed off\\\" shotguns and later failed to appear for trial: Despite repeated \\\"good faith\\\" efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people were taking an \\\"offensive action\\\" against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.  The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution alleged, want to become a \\\"regular supplier\\\").  The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly, but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date. The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found, there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic: However, agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to \\\"look at the body\\\" [not recover?] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.  Prosecution quote: \\\"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made that confrontation.\\\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist  Defense quote: \\\"The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit.\\\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]  Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including \\\"Tim\\\" again.  \\\"Tim\\\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \\\"ordinary, working class people.\\\"  He also claimed he was for \\\"white pride, not white power.\\\"  Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.  In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement, repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the \\\"sawed off\\\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another good one!).  Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence.  Drew =============================================================  \",\": I need help with my '85 ZX900A, I put Supertrapp slip-on's on it and : had the carbs re-jetted to match a set of K&N filters that replaced : the stock airbox.     Ahh, and just how were the carbs rejeted to \\\"match\\\" the changes you made to the bike? A stage three kit from K/N or Dynojet?  : Now I have a huge flat spot in the carburation at : about 5 thousand RPM in most any gear.     Isn't rejetting fun?   : This is especially frustrating : on the highway, the bike likes to cruise at about 80mph which happens : to be 5,0000 RPM in sixth gear.  I've had it \\\"tuned\\\" and this doesn't : seem to help.  I am thinking about new carbs or the injection system : from a GPz 1100.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a fix besides : restoring it to stock? :    New CARBS??? Why would that fix it? you still have to get the  jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition. You added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters.  Chances are it's to lean. BUT! This may not be,that's the big fun with  carb tuning. It's _very_ tricky.    Your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  Dyno and have he tune the carbs for your current set up. Otherwise you'll be playing a guessing game for a long time...   ==============================================================================   Erik Astrup                  AFM #422                              DoD #683     1993 CBR 900RR  *  1990 CBR 600  *  1990 Concours  *  1989 Ninja 250 \",\"    Just to address this one point, what about the two Katyusha rocket  attacks made within Lebanon, for which Fatah claimed responsibility.

After a review with a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, you might start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with:   97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and  Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on  the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session,  February, 1982.  GPO No. 88-618-O  This authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearly turns your \\\"interpretation\\\" into specious claptrap, which is a polite way of saying utter bullshit.  In spite of your false assertion to the contrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individual citizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.  And, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information, asserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globally distributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for  your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).   A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to openlook-request@unify.com (or openlook-request%unify@uunet.uu.net) for information.

A mailing list (amiga-x11@nic.funet.fi) for topics related to the port  of X11 to the Amiga can be subscribed by sending to mailserver@nic.funet.fi a  message containing   Subject: Adding myself to AMIGA-X11   SUBS AMIGA-X11 Your Real Name  A mailing list discussing ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI (Object Interface) toolkit can be subscribed to at oi-users-requests@bbn.com.  A mailing list discussing multi-threaded Xlib can be subscribed to at mt-xlib-request@xsoft.xerox.com.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   5)  How can I meet other X developers?    O'Reilly and Associates sponsors a mailing list for the use of X user  group organizers; subscribe by sending to listserv@ora.com the message  \\\"subscribe xgroups your@internet.address\\\".   Local area X user's groups are listed in Issue 4 of O'Reilly's X  Resource journal; a list may also be available from xug@ics.com.   The French X User Group is called AFUX and is based in Sophia Antipolis by CERICS. Information can be obtained from Miss Vasseur or Miss Forest; BP  148; 157, rue Albert Einstein; 06561 Valbonne Cedex; Phone: +33 93 95 45 00 /  45 01; Fax: +33 93 95 48 57.  [10/90]   The European X User Group was formed in 1989 to represent X users in  Europe.  It holds technical conferences at regular intervals. The EXUG also  publishes a regular newsletter which is distributed free of charge to members.  The EXUG also runs a email mailing list for members which is frequently used to address issues of European interest in X. The EXUG can be contacted at P.Whitehead@cc.ic.ac.uk, +44 (071) 225 8754, fax +44 (071) 823 9497.   GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.  The FAQ in comp.mail.mh (gatewayed to MH-users@ics.uci.edu) includes a  section on xmh.  The FAQ in comp.lang.lisp contains information on several interface tools and toolkits.  There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.  (nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about 50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)

The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power, mamamia, that's pretty hot.

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.

It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets.  There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.  What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.  As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.  As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is, without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.  If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data, because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.  When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there. \",\"From article <1pf5qe$b3b@seven-up.East.Sun.COM>, by jorge@erex.East.Sun.COM (Jorge Lach - Sun BOS Hardware): \",\" No.  There are two problems here:  (1) Peter died two millenia ago.

My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

It's a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do the shifting.   That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out  minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions  (Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift, either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.  As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on  'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual.

Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town.  Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient.  He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to the knees).  Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.  -Marc. --  --\",\" Do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the individual programs _in_ the program groups?

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).

The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an entirely easy thing to do) and clean the \\\"legs\\\" of the 68000. Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades:  the 68000's \\\"legs\\\" will oxidize, causing  unusual system errors.  Well, that's me.  So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.  Will someone provide the extra 3%?\",\"       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Been a while since you hit the PIP? The pavement (at least until around  exit 9) is for sh*t these days.

But I seem to have no control over the length of this field. In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters, in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by  PANEL_MAX_VALUE!   As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h> contains the following bit:   /* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,   * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes   */  PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,    152),  PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,   182),  which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders. But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.  Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me, and clear this problem?  Any help is very much appreciated.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!

Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it.  There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely a digital chip.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.

As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake.

As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

I didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X?

Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so.  However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats.  PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace. It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society, in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.  I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.\",\" Please, leave heaven out of it.  For his own sake, I pray that Dan does take it literally because that's how God intended it to be taken.

You've got a point, though.  There are some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly don't have an answer to this.  [insert deletion]   My parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do with it.

So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.\",\"    In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish, but there are certainly exceptions.

(See quote above.)    You'd lose that wager, if the supporting argument were part of it.   Did you know that Hitler himself was a devout Christian?  And heterosexual?  --Drywid\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"  Hmmm..

I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.

In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \\\"We are watching them very closely.\\\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"The Ottwawa Senators fired Mel Bridgman at 1:00 PM today.

It is a 14\\\" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half a year and I love it.   Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only complaint was that they did not always return my calls.   I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's (800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.  -David\",\"  That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".

Here is a simplified way of looking at it: The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not taking multiple directories into account.\",\"Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of \\\"Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters\\\"?

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry \\\"average\\\", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.  (And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to \\\"abandon\\\" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)\",\" No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those discussions, a spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to  some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on  the sensors that might be carried.  Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher -- certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA for, e.g.,  launch support would probably  cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.   No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per  Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to  see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all,  the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was (or a parade balloon, for that matter).  While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly draw attention to space.     Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.   As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.  I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers. Commercial projects, however, generally don't get \\\"funding\\\" -- they get \\\"customers\\\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.  Nahh.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.  Dani Eder \",\"Hi! Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).\",\"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent: Morning show:   In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12 Noon:   I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2 PM:   At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the \\\"homer\\\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys') I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to 4PM:   This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7 PM:   MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to Midnight:   S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.

I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"?

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.

Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is \\\"equivalent average?\\\"  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.   I'd put him about there too.    Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \\\"error.\\\"  Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. \\\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\\\" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's  worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are  other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago):  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his feelings:  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \\\"obvious\\\"ly wrong to be angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \\\"forgive them Father, they know not what they do.\\\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  \\\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.\\\"  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,\",\"Does anyone on this newsgroup happen to know WHY morphine was first isolated from opium?

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) \",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias.  The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations. So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.  \",\"  CNN just claimed he bought 104 \\\"semi-automatic assault rifles\\\".  And they say Koresh wasn't god-like...

I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \\\"Word of God\\\", \\\"inerrant\\\", \\\"infallibale\\\", \\\"The Manufacturer's Handbook\\\", \\\"The only rule of faith and practice in the church today\\\" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks \\\"Where are you?\\\" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like \\\"I'm here in this tree.\\\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\",\" I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have 1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is  1024x768.  -- \",\" : Upon arriving at home, Joseph probably took advantage of Mary...had his way : with her so to speak.

Incidentally, my MP has responded to my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved' countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the capabilities of the base station.  The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but  cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can listen without having to obtain a warrant.  But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?  I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can, at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D.

(not a SE/30, but the plain old SE);  if possible,  would I get any speed increase?  what would be the reference of the chip?  thanks in advance,  \",\" John 12:24-26: \\\"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.   \\\"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   \\\"If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"        I wonder if he realizes the irony of a Federal Secretary invoking a rabid anti-federalist in support of federal education programs?       \",\"someone gave me this brand new card.

If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives. Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small that it is scary. So by searching for the \\\"why\\\" along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.  Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the FBI gets their pet \\\"wiretap without leaving the office\\\" scheme. There is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours, everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible.  Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed.  Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not willing to make that leap of faith.   I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.  All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years. Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?  If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick.   Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny.  I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here. Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has happened elsewhere.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/keyboards Version: $Revision: 5.11 $ $Date: 1993/04/13 01:20:43 $  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------       Answers To Frequently Asked Questions about Keyboard Alternatives -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Alternative Keyboard FAQ Copyright 1992,1993 By Dan Wallach <dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu>  The opinions in here are my own, unless otherwise mentioned, and do not represent the opinions of any organization or vendor.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port         2. X terminals         3. NeXT         4. Silicon Graphics         5. IBM RS/6000  6. Other stuff      1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port   If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard  (Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding  a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation  runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used  PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable  to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read  the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.   The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.   a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and  even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server  extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your  server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings  appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,  you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,  or bugging your vendor.   kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.  Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.   Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals   Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use  PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all  set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the  trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add  extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around  for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT   NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop  Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they  were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of  upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics   Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and  beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't  believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not  possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by  upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more  details.      5. IBM RS/6000   IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||  Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||  cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||  smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||  it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||  works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||  told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||  anything new, please send me e-mail.        ||          6. Other stuff   Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)  support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your  queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can  get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either  from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in  luck.  Contact the companies for more details.   Apple Adjustable Keyboard     Apple Computer, Inc.     Sales offices all over the place.      Availability: February, 1993     Price: $219     Supports: Mac only      Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate     backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are     arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.      The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.     A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.      The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not     directly attachable to the keyboard.      As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from     TidBITS available there.   FlexPro Keyboard     Key Tronic     Phone: 800-262-6006     Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299     Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops      Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)     Price: $489 (?)     Supports: PC only (highly likely)      Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's     another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.     The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.      Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.   DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)     Dragon Systems, Inc.     320 Nevada Street     Newton, MA  02160      Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200     Fax: 617-527-0372      Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and is  available via anonymous ftp:   soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z  export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)   If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want  to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about  this sort of thing.      Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.     Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles     (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.      Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file     for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.     On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between     words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.     I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.      The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.     The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

The thumbs have     a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles     QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

You purchase     \\\"compatibility modules\\\", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and     then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.      It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each     section is on a \\\"custom telescoping universal mount.\\\"  Each section     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each     individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the     keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly     smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize     finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,     backspace, etc.).      You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't     allow the reconfig).

Yes, we do.    Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn't have access to).  The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.   The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a \\\"this is how well he hit *last* year, in major league terms\\\" rating.  So, in essence, he has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.   Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place and last place, but no more.   Sure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really in contention.    If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training could interpret as \\\"failure\\\".  Just because I think spring training numbers are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.

The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable.  My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment  space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon, I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?

I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but that's not really relevant at the moment.  I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.  I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon    could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the    ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being    mined today).  Why Paul, it's obvious. Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth, as is being advocated by some groups, Ti prices will sharply increase (we are of course not allowed to assume any developments in Ti processing).

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I  hate that team anyway.  \",\"  ( in <1993Apr16.163729.867@batman.bmd.trw.com> )   ( responding to Dave \\\"First With Official A.A Nickname\\\" Fuller )   [ ... ]  That means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.  Those who don't want to live the rest of their lives in jail would always have this option.\",\"I recently purchased a Diamond Stealth 24 Video card and received the wrong drivers.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on  141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/  The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from POVRay 1.0 \",\"MELITTIN\",\"John Berryhill, Ph.D. writes   umm, please don't lump us all together.

>Loud pipes are a biligerent exercise in ego projection,  No arguements following, just the facts.  I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my *stock* Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention.  I instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn. Don't know why, but I did it and it worked. Thats rather important.  I am not saying \\\"the louder the pipes the better\\\". My Harley is loud and it gets me noticed on the road for that reason. I personally do not feel it is to loud. If you do, well thats to bad; welcome to  America - \\\"Home of the Free, Land of the Atlanta Braves\\\".  If you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal government to get involved and pass Db restrictions; it should be generous enough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed. Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle. Should we get into how many feet a bike going 55mph goes in .30 seconds; or how long it would take me to push my horn button??  And aren't you the guy that doesn't even have a bike???\",\"Is there anyone out there running a Chicago National  League Ballclub list?

I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said, I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go  for the extra cubes.    I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note  and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I  couldn't afford a Duc.  Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, I'll probably be getting a 900SS next year...  - Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mark S.

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us. The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as  KaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to  talk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not also setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.\",\"  DIs it possible to track down \\\"zuma\\\" and determine who/what/where \\\"seradr\\\" is?

The post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held.

Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.  Michael\",\"   Right.

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality is relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their moral system.  I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost every moral system agrees on these two points.     (me)   /(hudson) /Generally, Christians believe in a Creator-Creation distinction.  Other /religions believe in one big whole.   I don't accept yor premises.  Too bad.  I know I'm right, so I get to enforce my view upon you whether you like my premise or not.  And since you can't prove otherwise, there isn't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my viewpoint.       /(hudson) /I don't think so.  once morality becomes relative, it degenerates.

Well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism (as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously, then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.  Whose absolutist moral system do we choose?    How do we come to this decision?  What about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?      /(hudson) /But if morality is considered to /be relative, and this rule isn't based on anything, but is just an arbitrary /rule, people might abandon it.

Revving the throttle requires either engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are on the road!).

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a \\\"jingoistic rant\\\", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"  Right.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same new Jew who has \\\"learned\\\" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" have racist connotations. On the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, \\\"I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor\\\". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\",\" Well, maybe it will be.

Thanks in advance,\",\"I just overheard that San Jose Coach George Kingston was officially terminated today...  Maybe good news, maybe bad.  I kinda liked him, but he seemed to lack a certain fire. \",\"   This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the   belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.  This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe  in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond  hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.    How did they shoot themselves in the foot?     There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists   can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).      Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:    Strong atheism - \\\"I believe god does not exist\\\"   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - \\\"I don't believe in a god\\\"       a negative belief    these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.  \",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\" It likely has nothing to do with \\\"chunks of plaque\\\" but it sounds like you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical attention *before* doing any more weight lifting.                    --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"Jesus:     Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an easy and as straight forward as it reads.  Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you. And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone. Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with  whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.    Jesus uses the word \\\"men\\\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out. Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man. Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian  is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian  can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know existed.   So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives, and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth, which do you choose?   And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light,  who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was their downfall to death.   And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him. David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.  Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago.    So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh. They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot.  Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?   Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded,  was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case, Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It didn't work with Jesus.    Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate? Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None  of them had an excuse.  \",\"I have a lot of CDs for sale.  Prices are $7 per CD and $3 per CD Single. CDs are noted by (CD) and CD Singles by (CDS).

My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there in a month or so.  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church.  Needless to say that I have found that there is no \\\"hard and fast\\\" rule when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted. But I'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the trick lies in the letter of dispensation.  But that is not why I am here....  What I'd like to know is:    What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions?   My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood...   I have heard that if two religions combine soon, it would be these two.  Any help would be appreciated...  Thanks so much!

Islamic Fundamentalists just have a \\\"better\\\" excuse (Qu'ran).       from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990     by John Davidson, Canadian Press       MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old     daughter that shocks the most.       \\\"I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what     happened to your parents,\\\" wrote Patrick Prevost. \\\"I loved     your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.\\\"       Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his     apartment in northeast Montreal.       They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after     killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.       The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had     gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money     for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked     his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.       She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or     lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.       Five children have also been slain as a result of the same     domestic \\\"battles.\\\"       Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their     husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across     Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for     Justice. [rest of article ommited]   Then to say that women are somehow \\\"better\\\" or \\\"should\\\" be the one to \\\"stay home\\\" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often  more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should stay home to do so!\",\"Does anyone have a rear wheel for a PD they'd like to part with?

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?       [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the           commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.           Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]    Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to:       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\",\" In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just \\\"came to know\\\" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for \\\"40 days\\\", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \\\"ends\\\" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \\\"approved\\\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\\\"coming to know\\\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \\\"members only\\\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \\\"not everything is in the Bible\\\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the \\\"versus\\\" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- \",\"I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection Faults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.

Here is another one:    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.   Serdar Argic\",\"   I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence  and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for  each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require  different levels of evidence.   As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.   The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the  level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the  consequences of the proposition are.     If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain  why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between  two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their  distance apart.    Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the  consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of  affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law,  they are irrelevent when theorizing about the \\\"Truth\\\" of the law.   Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including  the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of  affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find \\\"The Truth\\\"?     By the way, what is \\\"Truth\\\"? Please define before inserting it in  the conversation. Please explain what \\\"Truth\\\" or \\\"TRUTH\\\" is. I do think that  anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a \\\"Truth\\\", we could  never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.  --          \\\"Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land, It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because, for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin), living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon. The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of it.   It's called commerce.

Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town   on a rail. \",\"From article <eabu288-140493210752@dialin33635.slip.nts.uci.edu>, by eabu288@orion.oac.uci.edu (Alvin):  --Could be.

While I'm not real sure of his credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or something like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold would be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800; now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind because a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.  The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and forget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if there any of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that can pretty definitely be said to have not come true?\",\" 1992 HONDA ACCORD FOR SALE 35,000 MILES ALL HIGHWAY MILES EXCELLENT CONDITION WHITE EX MODEL \\\"LOADED\\\" $15,000 OR BEST OFFER call tom @ (201) 653-0638 h            (201) 795-5636 w  \",\"The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday afternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game.\",\"I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:   1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller  2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)  3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)  4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days    (getting happier)  5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)  6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days    (cooling off, the end is in sight)  7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad   (VERY unhappy)  Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)  and have on-site service install it for me. BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.

I won't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks.  The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:  1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just     now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.  2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able     to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I     find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy     for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the     administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for     all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made     widely available.)  Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  The majority of the discussion involving this \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?  I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session key?)  If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret? :-)\",\"  I don't see the effort to equate salvation with paradise.

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler. (Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)\",\":  : >> Please enlighten me.

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.

They have not, to my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could make one, technologically.  The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller circuitry present on NuBus Macs.  Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted, there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.\",\" IF you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most  punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and  knees.

I thought I would post an article I found in the Saturday, April 17, 1993 Toronto Star:                    'CLIPPER CHIP' to protect privacy     Washington (REUTER) - President Bill CLinton announced yesterday a plan to plant a new \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" in every government telephone and computer line to prevent eavesdropping.     Eventually the chips, developed by the government's National Institute for Standards and Technology, would be used by commercial and private electronics communication users.     The White House said that to assure privacy, each device containing the encryption devices would be assigned two unique \\\"keys\\\" - numbers that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.     The attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the keys are deposited in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases. Access to them would be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap, the White House said in a statement.                                -30-    Dan McKinnon\",\"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\"        I'd hate to rehash an old thread, but...  Would someone kindly quote a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX, and Escort GT.

I had the pleasure of driving him back to the  airport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I  thought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons  you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes  savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that  the Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather  than in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.  Pretty prescient.  Yes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price  stickers (I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe).\",\"   Two questions:  1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for    \\\"real hunting\\\".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using    self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not    for deer, then what about other, smaller game?  2)  When did I get the nickname \\\"NRA man\\\"?  Notice I have never referred    to you as \\\"Janette\\\" which you don't seem to like.  Do I get any    super-powers, like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man?

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However, it is surprising that the \\\"Evil AntiGun Empire \\\" (Darth Vader breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare \\\"All legitimate gun defenses\\\" vs. \\\"All gun crimes.\\\"  Instead,  it's always \\\"All legitimate gun defenses,\\\"  which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just  criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which the victim died.  Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred.  -Case Kim\",\"Hi,   I have normal procomm plus for dos, but I've been considering buying the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper.

I used to enjoy reading them throughout the summer for the last two years.  Inquisitively yours,  Joel\",\"The following is a survey we are conducting for a term project in a philosophy class. It is not meant to give us anything interesting statistically; we want to hear what kind of voices there are out there. We are not asking for full- blown essays, but please give us what you can.  As I do not read these groups often, please email all responses to me at shimpei@leland.stanford.edu. As my mail account is not infinite, if you can delete the questions and just have numbered answers when you write back I would really appreciate it.  Since we would like to start analyzing the result as soon as possible, we would like to have the answers by April 30. If you absolutely cannot make it by then, though, we would still liken to hear your answer.  If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect would like to have the answers by April 30. If you absolutely cannot make it by then, though, we would still like to hear your answer.  If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect (or better yet, include a note along with your survey response) and I'll try to email it to you, probably in late May.  SURVEY:  Question 1) Have you ever had trouble reconciling faith and reason? If so, what was the trouble? (For example: -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism                holds more truth?               -Do you practice tarot cards, palm readings, or divination that                conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world?               -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that                you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you?) Basically, we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your _REASON_tells you is wrong.  Question 2) If you have had conflict, how did/do you resolve the conflict?  Question 3) If you haven't had trouble, why do you think you haven't? Is there a set of guidelines you use for solving these problems?

A general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases, by establishing links to the \\\"Lyme community\\\", treating patients who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as MS are probably spirochetal, if not Lyme, giving talks at meetings of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional patients, etc.  This GP can go from being a run-of-the-mill $100K/yr GP to someone with lots of patients in the hospital and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his office, and making lots of bread.

Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"MLB Standings and Scores for Friday, April 16th, 1993                     (including yesterday's games)  NATIONAL WEST       Won  Lost   Pct.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this into the next \\\"official\\\" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm, and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?  One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)  In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing, look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title; but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:          +=========+   +---------+   +=========+         + title B +   + title A +   + title C +         +-------------------------------------+         +   this is the body of the window,   +         +   window A, which is on top.        +         +-------------------------------------+   ===================  The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long.  The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.  Since then, \\\"blast\\\" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

If not, I'd suggest you  look for an '89 ZX-7, since they only have about 90 horsepower, whereas the '90 has over 100 and might be a bit much for you...  Sincerely, Nathaniel\",\"  No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.   Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim  in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually _use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.) It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more common. That's why it is important to look at the overall (not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of substitution, different criminal techinques of using different weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.   \\\"Face\\\"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun than actually stabbed with a knife.   Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman  without much problem.  You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore, using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case) a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a \\\"serious threat\\\" nearly as often as they do guns.\",\"If you'd like to find a home for that beekeeping equipment you'll never use again, here's a likely victim, uh, customer.

I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S. and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy  their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany, Japan and many other \\\"industrial rivals\\\" more than these two.   In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B.,  propping up these economies and further providing an incentive  to keep prices from falling too low.\",\" This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do is to suspend Bobby Cox.

The original article has reappeared, so:      The President today announced a new initiative that will bring     the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary     program to improve the security and privacy of telephone     communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law     enforcement.  Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on ordinary landlines.      The initiative will involve the creation of new products to     accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure     telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications links.  OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's misfortunes).  Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio links.  OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.  My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise (IMHO).

Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on \\\"Creating larger than recommended swapfile\\\".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money.  And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.

It would keep me up and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've read about it... not just from my own personal experience.    Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually becomes unconscious.  The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine) and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when it really \\\"kicks in\\\").  Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as good of care of my hearing as I should.  Her reaction is normal.

Pre-game comments ----------------- Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed \\\"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.\\\"  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club'.... \\\"NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.\\\"   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\"I can't find CTDS (Connect The Dots Smoother) in France.

Indurkhya                        TUTORIAL PROGRAM Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on  Tuesday, July 6.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer   Scientists\\\"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)  This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is  intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists  who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.   Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the \\\"central dogma\\\" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists\\\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis\\\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\\\"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\\\"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

From your post, you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help  to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large  proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is  laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But  nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has  socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a  dysfunction.  Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us. Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they  are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good  hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it  werent' so damn typical.\",\" If \\\"ownership\\\" were rightly based on \\\"worthiness\\\" there wouldn't be any owners. What is your point?

After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant posting.  *** file follows ***   Hi Folks;  As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.  Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things start today.  More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, \\\"Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget) Weaver?\\\"  On the evening news she said, \\\"I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I thought we all did.\\\"  Nice sound bite (grin)!  The news reporter also interviewed some guy named \\\"Tim\\\" who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial. \\\"Tim\\\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).  Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.  Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

Will the higher : resolution be noticed for these? :  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"Rich Thompson posts some blather about the Libertarian Party:    What pray tell do the Libertarians know about winning elections?

I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\" That's open for debate.

Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated.  -Eric\",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary                     (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993                                  INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT                       BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF                     KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH                         Pittsburgh International Airport                      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania        10:40 A.M. EDT                     Q   For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike  Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh  International Airport and with me is the President of the United  States Bill Clinton.              And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.              THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.              Q   There are a lot of things we'd like to talk  about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just  breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been  kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in  the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard  that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and  Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been  found not guilty.              It's a situation that's been building for over a  year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.   And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see  the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your  administration and what you're trying to do.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the  American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a  tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the  efforts of the federal government in developing the case.              The law under which the officers were tried is a  complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury  decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible  for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did  most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked  Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some  blows, and another officer who was a rookie.              No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but  it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They  acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think  that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But  I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:   first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country  together and not violate the civil rights of any American;  secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.                I think it's important to recognize that in the  poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this  country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're  even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our  efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police  officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a  waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some  other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to  violence and drugs.              And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to  me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic  revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed  areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles  who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many  problems as we do.                And I laid out a very ambitious program in the  campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment  to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary,  Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies  for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest  unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the  country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to  the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several  other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with  regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.              Q   Let's talk about what brings you to the  Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a  lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.   You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you  said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break  that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to  Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that  battle?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First  of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported  me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in  economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it  gives the country a very different budget for the next five years  than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and,  at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and  health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.              But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the  short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money  to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half;  to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also  to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The  plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the  Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a  bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come  to a vote.              I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote  for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican  leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to  stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases  the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending  targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for  this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five  years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the  economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that  are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for  billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.              So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.   I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I  think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work  right now to show that we're changing the direction of the  country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.              Q   Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or  his office lately?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk  regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison  operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords  from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six  others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and  know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life  of the budget I presented.              You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've  got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth  is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life  of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we  have this program well below the spending targets that Congress  has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for  years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans  voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as  putting the American people back to work.                So I just hope that this doesn't become a political  issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and  the need for jobs.              Q   I have some questions from people who supported  you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.   It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot  of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I  think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the  White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go  through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And  they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull  it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew  it was going to be like this.              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask  people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving  very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the  fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in  history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we  are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on  political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole  wide range of things.                But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn  it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions  which led to the victory I received from the people in November,  and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making  real, real progress.                I would urge the people not to get discouraged.   We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going  to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing  things.              Q   Thank you very much.

I came  home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period  in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was  the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and  other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first  cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and  on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring  that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.  When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped  by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.  The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to  the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking  passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not  taken for Armenians.  We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old  building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was  packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th  Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \\\"Death to the Armenians\\\" was written on the cars.  When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call  Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.  Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to  come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you  enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was  beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,  that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people  were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very  long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,  looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said  things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that  they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that  there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of  the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later  found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too.  When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go  home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We  started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left.  We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . .  They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians  were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we  could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He  read the surname \\\"Danielian,\\\" turned the page, read \\\"Armenian,\\\" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the  courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,  pushed some of the keys on the piano and said \\\"your death has tolled.\\\" They  had knives and steel truncheons.  I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents  and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken  outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind  her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began  beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.  We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their  balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they  strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I  lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from  their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is  broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an  ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.  We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and  try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,  they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our  neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the  window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a  result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken  away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken  away, and everything will be OK.  But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12  o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with  some \\\"assistants.\\\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,  and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are  in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.  In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th.  Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was  released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first  they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out  that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.  My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My  mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the  leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.  They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely.  At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out  later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called  specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address  and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the  phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He  denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father  answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he  called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of  automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had  never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20  years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he  was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.  My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was  two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural  projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and  later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from  the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in  a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.   My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join  the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.  Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home  of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.  While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped  . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .  Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to  recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of  Armenia.  After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that.  I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I  think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.  You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had  even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move  here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and  that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct  a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies  in the hands of our government.  June 13,1988  Stepanakert  \",\"Sorry but I forgot this ps.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do.    There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying \\\"Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)\\\".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call.

Chris Powell.\",\"  I will answer this as I find time.   Notice what I said about this book.  I called it \\\"Easy reading.\\\"  The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:   \\\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\\\"    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, \\\"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\\\"  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway.\\\" It means that \\\"I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\\\"  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent \\\"whying\\\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.   \",\"Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple.

I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5.

We had a discussion about it a while ago.    Then OFM comments :   With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference was clear: \\\"You have nothing to do with the Church.\\\"  These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called \\\"the nature of the incarnate word\\\", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures \\\"human\\\" and   \\\"divine\\\"  that are   united in   one \\\"without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration\\\" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \\\"did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye\\\" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \\\"semantic\\\" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \\\"To the  Coptic Church, faith is more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us.\\\"  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren't.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.\",\"  The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a \\\"cancer on the team\\\", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   -- \",\"It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.  It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.   That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.\",\" I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder, I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions, of course, in which case you're on your own!!!  Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time) did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!  The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill - so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the shape of the object being filled!!!  Of course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all this and feel suitably :-)\",\"  Actually, this is incorrect.  French resistance may have played some part in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was supplied on D-Day.   Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which have not been asked to withdraw as well.  \",\":    Watch us soar in 1993!

Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed).

I stated that I  would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer \\\"for their own good\\\" or for any reason other than I was prevented from  doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your  chances of being \\\"offed\\\" or involved in an accident, especially if  this \\\"passer\\\" is riding your bumper.

(Though I am now unsure what that sentence does mean.)   You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to help the \\\"butchers of their choice\\\".  Since the primary targets of help are Muslim victims of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", you imply that such Muslim victims are butchers.   This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?   Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not be \\\"ethnic cleansed\\\".  The Serbians want to \\\"ethnic cleanse\\\" the Muslims.  It is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the things that the two sides want are not equivalent.   I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.  For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?

[]  Define \\\"armed better\\\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....

Using \\\"g\\\" to designate God and \\\"j\\\" to designate Jesus, and the predicate letter \\\"E\\\" for the property of being eternal, the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej.     The second premise appears to contain an \\\"is\\\" of identity, in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g.  But your remark that \\\"Jesus is a subset of God\\\" suggests that strict identity is not desired here.

Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but \\\"love the sinner\\\" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved.\",\" There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic.  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a \\\"friend of a friend\\\" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\",\"09 Apr 93, Susan Harwood Kaczmarczik writes to All:   >> \\\"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)  >> dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.

So, rather than be something secular, it is something  SHK> very sacred.  I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence \\\"humanism\\\"). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \\\"economics\\\" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \\\"the free rein of the market mechanism\\\", while for others it was \\\"the dialectical forces of history\\\". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24 DOUG WILSON  Season: 16th Acquired: '91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and   2nd round pick in '92 entry draft Grade:  I (B)  I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29 DEAN KOLSTAD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (C-/D+)  It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38 PAT MACLEOD  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (?)  MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a \\\"rehab assignment\\\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41 TOM PEDERSON  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (B+)  Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\\\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45 CLAUDIO SCREMIN  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  I (D+/D)  He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\",\"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the \\\"Space Age\\\" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \\\"What's New\\\" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \\\"mind children\\\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......\",\"We are trying to connect an Olivetti XM4311 5\\\" floppy drive as the second drive on a Panasonic 286 machine.

Is it to be \\\"instinctive not to murder\\\" or not?   It's not even correct.    Animals of the same species do kill one another.   Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.  I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance. I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem to exhibit self-awareness.   So what?     Are you trying to say that some killing in animals has a moral significance and some does not?   Is this your natural morality>    Are you blind?

I noted that Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law.  --clh]  He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted on the bible study group.  This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ to me.  n> ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  You cannot show, from scripture, that the weekly Sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws.   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin?  Interesting.  Where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation.  But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly spoken on.

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans have the right to Clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption. This implies that, ultimately, non-Clipper strong encryption must become illegal.  (As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about \\\"harmonious balance\\\" when they're talking about taking away people's right to communications privacy?)  Although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption is mentioned as well:    It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications, will be distributed only through the \\\"underground\\\".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that they are protecting their privacy.  It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.\",\"   I recall that the issue is that fat on the meat liquifies and then drips down onto the hot elements--whatever they are--that the extreme heat then catalyzes something in the fat into one or more carcinogens which then are carried back up onto the meat in the smoke.\",\" I tried the right set and it didn't work.

It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:  xwdtopnm <xwdfile> | # convert to PPM  [ppmtopgm |]  # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print  pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript  lpr   # print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4\\\" wide, use:  pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it  is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a  width less than 4\\\", and will thus be printed smaller than 4\\\" wide.  If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4\\\", and  will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified  paper width.   In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,  but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps.

I will not use styrofoam table service. Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called \\\"becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some.\\\"     Don't say \\\"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time    on.\\\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and    glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords    woven in the infinite tapestry.\",\"FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles.  \",\"I built it on a rs6000 (my only Motif machine) works fine.

The road surface isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.   It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.   I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130. It just isn't that fast or that dangerous.

Perhaps our goal is one of self-actualization.   Now you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.  This was not part of the original premise.

In a natural sense, it is not at all immoral to harm another species (as long as it doesn't adversely affect your own, I guess).\",\"--------------------------- The federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in order to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people being pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically. It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally they wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god, they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need such an ability in federal jurisdiction. -RSW \",\"Roger Maynard shares his views, with the masses, on Bob Gainey and life in general:         It was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious 'boarding' from behind...Trottier was given a major.   But Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill as a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the boards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's skills?     I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.   I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him on this list.

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a \\\"crosswire\\\" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on \\\"busy cursors\\\" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to 'None'.\",\"According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite the two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the Penguins.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\\            XXXXX|                            |      \\\\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\\\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\\\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \\\"tuning\\\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.

Watch the video.......\",\"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.

Advice from a grad student.   I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.  This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity amplifier:                   +-----/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\-------+                  |                  |                  |    /--------\\\\    | INPUT -+-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| -      |    |        |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT        +-/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\--+----| +      |                  |    \\\\--------/                  | CONTROL ---------X (analog switch)                  |                  |                 ---                 GND  All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed, the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show up as carrier feed-through).  For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems, especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't). \",\"I have two pairs of headphones I'd like to sell.

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to \\\"have hardware which will blow anything else away\\\", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as \\\"Bill\\\" and claims to be the \\\"MS-iah\\\".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of \\\"interpersonal computing\\\" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.

God's laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:\",\" So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on, Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant. Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two goaltenders.   YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesn't have a game like that in him.   Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah, Dom has played well too.   FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning, Kasper...   Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.\",\"Here is a different viewpoint.   In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.   A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer)  A sage said to me: \\\"Do you want one copy or lots of copies?\\\", \\\"One\\\",  \\\"Inkjet\\\".    Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a  laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers  actually use this facility. (there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)\",\"The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.  I believe the reason that he & I \\\"click\\\" instead of \\\"bash\\\" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The \\\"kitchen of heaven\\\" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of \\\"God's house\\\" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday & raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where I can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.\",\" >   >   > SOmebody mentioned  a re-boost of HST during this mission,  meaning  > that Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.  >    I haven't heard any hint of a re-boost, or that any is needed.   >   > why not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled  > thruster module  to  HST,   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be  > cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.

Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow.

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. \\\"What could be better,\\\" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      \\\"It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,\\\" announced Ryne Sandberg.  \\\"If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to win.      \\\"Lord, I hope we pull it off.\\\"      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  \\\"Cool Papa\\\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        \\\"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\\\"  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  \\\"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,\\\" remarked Lou Brock.  \\\"I don't see why we can't win this division.\\\"      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     \\\"When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitcher's park like this,\\\" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that \\\"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\\\"  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, \\\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\\\"      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \\\"Normally,\\\" Drysdale remarked, \\\"I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't Davis will get decked once.\\\"      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  \\\"It's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit home runs',\\\" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      \\\"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\\\" he explained.      \\\"How can we do that,\\\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      \\\"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.\\\"      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      \\\"We're mostly a power team,\\\" remarked Ron Cey.  \\\"Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.

The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14\\\" CTX 1468NI, 128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is $2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of the motherboard they are using (the Aetana).

I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++.  My question is:  How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed.  If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.\",\"Thanks, Steve, for your helpful and informative comments on Mac stereo sound.

Although two months  have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I  have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at   almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from  Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly  slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to  save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful  events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then  taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers  who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and  Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the   Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.   I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is   destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it.)  However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact, we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis.  Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.  Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis.  There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an \\\"efficient\\\" manner; I call it political market failure.  Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to swallow the \\\"whole libertarian agenda.\\\"\",\"******* *******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *******    Boy am i glad you decided to read this. I've got a problem that  I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   \\\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right.

Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are \\\"blind\\\" in various ways.  Some of these are:    o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not \\\"blind\\\" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.\",\" Unless I'm imaging things, (always a possibility =) 1992 QB1, the Kuiper Belt object discovered last year, is known as Smiley. \",\"I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's get value function.

In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:   - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry  - someone's sick idea of flirting  - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying \\\"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\\\"  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: \\\"ignore it and it will go away\\\", \\\"you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\\\", \\\"you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way\\\", \\\"you are just an object\\\", \\\"you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?\\\", \\\"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\\\" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After all, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall topics.  Thanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you, Esther \",\"Does any one out there listen to WFAN?

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\"To my fellow Columbian, I must ask, why do you say that I engage in fantasies?

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.  By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses.

The article was titled \\\"Government slowly eroding our liberties\\\", and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who          explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from         Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and         then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.         You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it         up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being         cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.         If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken         a little bit at a time.

Of course, I said \\\"No problem\\\" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.

All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge the condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul  1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians.  Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider    returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.    Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.

Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various players that were coming into the NHL.

AIDS activists  welcomed the  new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand  the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  \\\"We've known about this  for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain,\\\" said Jesse  Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who   believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the  West, said, \\\"We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even  if these papers are right.\\\"       ======================================================================                                    April 14, 1993      ======================================================================     \\\"Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal\\\" Washington Post  (04/14/93), P. A9        The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care   professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in  today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131  patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital  were found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by  Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said,  \\\"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal  precautions are strictly observed.\\\"   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer  (04/14) P.

The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  \\\"They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,\\\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists'  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \\\"The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It   will take them several years to accept the nature of research.\\\"    Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator  at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \\\"Here is a  wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the  Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much  more [than  public relations].\\\"  ======================================================================    \\\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\\\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143,  No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)        Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\\\" Journal of the  American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \\\"Earth in the  Balance\\\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    \\\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\\\" Journal of the American   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \\\"a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\\\"   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \\\"is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\\\"  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  \\\"This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\\\" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \\\"We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.\\\"   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS.   \\\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,\\\" said Dr. McNamara.  \\\"We'll also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.\\\"   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals'  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \\\"turned  on,\\\" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the  mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common  infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\\\"       Secretary Shalala said, \\\"This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\\\"       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST)  Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.

The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       \\\"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,\\\" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G.

M.D., M.P.H.  \\\"This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\\\"       \\\"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,\\\" said HRSA's associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G.

Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?

My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And \\\"given by god\\\" refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.\",\" I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

(then again i tend to be somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)  this also relates to the serbian \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" question.  i have been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs we condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and killed?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them, if that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.    i'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a different title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.  peace (shalom), vera shanti _______________________________________________________________________________ Hand over hand    noye@midway.uchicago.edu Doesn't seem so much   (Vera Noyes) Hand over hand     Is the strength of the common touch drop me a line if you're in the mood  - Rush, \\\"Hand Over Fist\\\" _______________________________________________________________________________  [I am also worried about this issue.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"Okay, this is a long shot.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

I will oblige.  My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.  The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds.  Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published  several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.  I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.\",\"Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:    In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\"I'm trying to set up a personal studio.

A food industry businessman?  You must personally know a lot of them for you to be able to be so certain that they are evil mosters whose only goal is to inflict as much pain and disease as possible into the general public.

Of course not!  (Although I would think that a person like you would be a big fan of such recycling if that were the case).    On occasion that's probably the case, but in general the idea is that MSG improves the flavor of certain foods.     No.     No.     Obviously.     As I recall, these are natural by-products of heating up certain foods. They don't \\\"put it in there\\\".     have a number of criteria in choosing how to process food.  They want to make it taste good, look good, sell for a good price, etc.  The fact that they use it tells me that THEY think that it contributes to those goals they are interested in.  One of those goals is NOT \\\"making people sick\\\".  Such a goal woud quickly drive them out of business and for no benefit.     Warning of what?  In California there is a law requiring that ANYTHING which contains a carcinogen be labeled.  That includes every gasline pump, most foods, and even money cleaning machines (because Nickel is a mild carcinogen). The result is that now nobody pays any attention to ANY of the warnings.     Why?  What if not 30% of people wanted to buy this ugly, rotten, not-as-tasty food?  I guess it will just be wasted, huh?  How terribly efficient.     Because it makes food look better.  I LIKE food that looks good. If vitamin companies want to do that it is fine, but who are you to tell THEM how to make vitamins?  Who are you to tell ME whether I should buy flavored vitamins for my kids (who can't swallow the conventional ones whole).     How do you define \\\"junk\\\"?  Is putting \\\"salt\\\" in food bad?
