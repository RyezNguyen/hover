Some of the land was in fact given to the   Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab   absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase   from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the   partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of   defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.  *** First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the   idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who   claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West   bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion   to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis   promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining   possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats   national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it   is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them   and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs   continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they   can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West   Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is   the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West   Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even   leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't   going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town   on a rail. \",\" There was a Volvo owner that had $3000 dollars worth of improvements to the  looks of the car by hail :). \",\"    I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these acts is blasphemy against God.

Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically removing the physical \\\"proofs\\\" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase science is removing our props.

The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device. So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.

So a \\\"hourglass\\\" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a \\\"caution\\\" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a \\\"crosswire\\\" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so?

Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown     by the Graphite and #9GXE's \\\"cheating\\\".

The big \\\"cheat\\\" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and     PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't     do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing     PC Magazine says is that scores are not \\\"legitimate\\\" -- couldn't they     at least make some comment about its real-world performance?

I've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick.  I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.

But that's OK, I understand you have a hockey background. Stats like \\\"plus/minus\\\" make RBI look good.   OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Roger:  Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the \\\"Red Jays\\\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \\\"had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\\\"   This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

Matt\",\"I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs. a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit.    At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...  Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated.    Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a way to take advantage of that fact.

Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K. Topuzian Assistant Professor Northwestern University Skoie, Illinois.  TIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'   You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed. Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,  Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn  massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of  expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\\\"  Serdar Argic\",\"Hello,   I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World] a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be used to \\\"recycle your old SIMMs,\\\" when you upgraded memory.  I don't remember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised in any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk.

On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were \\\"melting in fear.\\\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God's work?\",\"I would realy like to hear from someone that has one of these NANAO T560i monitors that is driving it with a Diamond SpeedStar 24x.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).

It's both a fast printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back (a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

Darby was one of the founders of the \\\"Plymouth Brethren\\\" and an early supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved of his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other languages.   This was from the same fellow who did Young's Concordance, which was a standard reference work, similar to Strong's concordance.   I believe that these just follow standard reference works.

VGA:  The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked   at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About   1/2 the speed, as I recall.    The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the    P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid   is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses   the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.      I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as   the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.   (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)  Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look like?  Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?

However, you may be speaking of \\\"Public Missle, Inc.\\\", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.  Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more  powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadable form, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of used at special occasions.  To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal  structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of a model rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights. These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large national launches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engine flights.  Actually, using a > G engine constitutes the area of \\\"High Power Rocketry\\\", which is seperate from normal model rocketry.  Purchase of engines like I have been describing require membership in the National Association of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc., or you have to be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.  Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this, but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuels and what not.  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved, but I'm sure they are numerous.\",\"  Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side of wall maybe? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it.  Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes). I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor.  BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN. Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other sources.\",\"Koc) responded to article <1993Apr22.152937.14766@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.  [DD]  Problem 1 [DD] [DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  [DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed  [DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the  [DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army.  [DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the  [DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army.  [DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to  [DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers  [DD] there were before the massacre.  [Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760  Good for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri  soldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate the area of Armenians!  [Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After [Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.  Fact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in       this seventh century story!  Fact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.  Fact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there       were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and       Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon        either!  Conclusion: Numbers don't lie in either case!   \",\"        What about Thaaammy Thotha?

#I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,  I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:  xwdtopnm <xwdfile> | # convert to PPM  [ppmtopgm |]  # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print  pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript  lpr   # print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4\\\" wide, use:  pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it  is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a  width less than 4\\\", and will thus be printed smaller than 4\\\" wide.  If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4\\\", and  will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified  paper width.   In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,  but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps. Marcel.\",\"Cloak yourself in God's sustaining and abiding love.

When the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)  On her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!  My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.  Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a  radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find such an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob-gyn can't, then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.

I know, there's the FAQ, etc.  But guess what -- if those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to _hard_ atheism?  They're not, and they won't.

How should I do it? A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those     people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to     various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers     are good, and know the common tricks.    So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.    Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially    if there is some \\\"key\\\" item that can get lost.    So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\",\"  What about U. Johnny Hodapp, the greatest 2nd baseman in Cleveland Indians history?  225 hits in 1930, consistantly over .300.

I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour.

It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is  16 Mbits a second. [...]   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips  N, a 30-bit serial number  U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted    with the chip  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then  fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:        E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.    Three questions: 1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:   E[M;K] = 64 bits   E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits   E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits    Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,    or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?       All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications    like cellular phones (or even regular phones over   2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?    Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,    or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only    transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into    everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?  3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?    Does the block have to be present at all?    Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,    it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's     limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,    and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness    (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets    it recognize a valid E[K;U].)        In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT    wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?    (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)    Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;    paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.     On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,    presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,    like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding.  As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his \\\"breakthrough\\\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\",\" Sure.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"I'm new to the hardware and with a mandate to port some X-based stereo-video software --- does anyone know of or have experience with X on Amiga machines?

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same new Jew who has \\\"learned\\\" to work it. Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" have racist connotations. On the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.  The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \\\"Hebrew labor\\\" to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, \\\"I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor\\\". 2) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\",\"16 bit MFM FD/HD controller  - $25/b.o.  copy card w/ software and cable - $30/b.o.

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground on the identical car in front of you!   If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?  Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy  a bunch of their stuff :).  One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of  security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to  deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you  look at it :).   Great!  Where can I buy it?  Another note: If \\\"Clipper\\\" increases the incentive to bring stronger  encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at  the moment.   I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it  from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.    You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a  restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making  cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.   Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.

Speaking from experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses. Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)  So on this point at least there's not so much worry.

Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive.

Cal over Chi in 5         and Cal over Pit in 6 (or 7) to take the SC\",\"    John, The problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without bothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that one needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the work of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time to examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will  grasp more clearly what I am saying.     Certainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most  clearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.\",\" Not just because of the riflemen.

It would have cost him a hell of a lot to take Switzerland, with no guarantee that an invasion would be successful.

A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.

It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive, which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs.  The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of which are pretty good.  The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around $600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle.  Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's speed and performance.   BTW, the models of the drives are:  Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)  CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it is also something like with 3401)  NEC:  CDR-74   I'm very happy with my drive.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION              1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                 produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He                 *would indeed* rise from the dead.\",\" >say they have a \\\"history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]\\\"? \",\" That's one.

But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and giving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some of the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, \\\"His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads\\\" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.   At the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think that doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which requires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can be no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider Job.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but doubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he  rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian it to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.\",\"Yep, at: oak.oakland.edu they have a couple different 68HC16 things in /pub/msdos/emulators and get the file 00-index.txt for a list of what they have. lige \",\"I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from a MC146818A Real Time Clock.

Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"      That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a record as Toronto.

Who would  ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People  ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did  ->heal people.     Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site. He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die. By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what  he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more  that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling, so the stories got bigger to appeal better.  -> Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn  ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example  ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see  ->this right away. -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the  ->real thing.     Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because in the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are  possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives.  However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the  incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at  least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid.  -> Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in  ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal  ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I  ->write I will use it.  JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet  fullfilled them anyway.  -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.

That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a  ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But  ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes  ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.   ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in  ->a while.  We box everything into time units.

Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says  seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for  Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun control laws.         I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.          Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the question of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to \\\"magically\\\" keep the guns out, but now isn't.)          The other side of the coin, of course, is that far \\\"illegal drugs\\\" are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally.  I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.           And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques of it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical.          The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions.          If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far higher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly lower.           The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. \\\"inner-city\\\" problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently they didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties.          True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.         The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented, just as happened in Canada.

Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must  be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of  Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to  the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.  All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of  Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the  Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.  It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples.   And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following  ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the  veracity of the Turkish Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle  of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and  consequently a number of governments and organizations have become  supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.

THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                 Dorothy Denning                             Revised, April 21, 1993   INTRODUCTION  On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"  In the latest case in Denver, they were giving away tickets to a Denver Nuggets basketball game.

You \",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".

We believe that the  ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the temple.

I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper.  The name of the encryption algorithm is \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  Martin Hellman had written                  and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                 producing                       E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  To which I responded:          My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the         \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK.          The unit key, also called the \\\"chip key,\\\" is generated from the         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 \\\"public domain\\\" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.   Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log   in as 'NODIS' (no password).    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,   no parity, one stop). At the \\\"Enter Number:\\\" prompt, enter MD and   carriage return. When the system responds \\\"Call Complete,\\\" enter a few   more carriage returns to get the \\\"Username:\\\" and log in as 'NODIS' (no   password).    NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of   what's there is available at present.  Earth Sciences Data -------------------    There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including   imagery. This listing is called \\\"Earth Sciences Resources on Internet\\\",   and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]   in the directory COGS under the name \\\"internet.resources.earth.sci\\\"    Some sites include:   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from         Magellan and Viking missions etc.         pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole         archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an         e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the         subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:          send SPACE Index         send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91          (Capitalization is important!

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17. Scientific visualization stuff ==================================  X Data Slice (xds) -------------------   Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT,   in the contrib directory.

For other information contact Doug Norton (e-mail: 74017.461@@compuserve.com)   IRIS Explorer -------------   It's an application creation system developed by Silicon   Graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for   computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her driving/maintenance habits.   I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the '91s were identical (except for the ABS option).     Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle, but I didn't see those listed in CR.   I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating.    The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.   I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see the dialog:   Me:  \\\"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\\\"   BK:  \\\"There is no truck.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around at look.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\\\"  Me:  \\\"Turn around or you will run over.\\\"  BK:  \\\"No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\\\"  Me:  \\\"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\\\"       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  \\\"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\\\"       And by the way, I really have an open mind.\\\"   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \",\" What kind of polygons?  Shaded?  Texturemapped?  Hm?

Maintaining a `just  friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.  \",\"Didn't McDonald's sell copies of \\\"Dances with Wovies\\\" for $7 not too long ago?

[I am WAY to liberal with my quotation marks tonight...]  In this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what  a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.  He said something to the effect of: \\\"You have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to have a license to own a dog.  You even have to have a license to fish. But, they'll anyone have a kid.\\\" [Keep in mind that I am, in NO way, trying to pass this off as a quote.  It is probably GROSSLY distorted but I think you get the point...]\",\"      You know, I never really appreciated them before!  \",\" I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.   The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a \\\"negative probability\\\" in most cases. Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.       No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.           No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \\\"negative chance\\\" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.\",\" Me too! And any Yankee Stadium gifs as well, please.

For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \\\"Sinus Survival\\\", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guarantee their safety.

I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.

Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\"One more thing to add, the Orchid board vesa bios is only able to handle the 1 meg dram on board, the Viper however can utilize the 2 meg vram on board to support vesa modes such as 1280x1024x256, 800x600x16 mil. and 1024x768x65536 under Dos.\",\"  I think the passage you're looking for is the following.  Matthew 5:17    \\\"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the  prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.  Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.  Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments  and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he  who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of  heaven.  Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of  the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to. (A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15.)  However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The \\\"not an iota or dot\\\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \\\"ceremonial law\\\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.\",\" I really must object to that last statement.

Rob bell@plains.nodak.edu \",\"Hi everyone,  I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups:  *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******  Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.  Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was   trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210   and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need   to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe   place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is   that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it   wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this   could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.    It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one   wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further   correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also   my NeXT that way.  Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any   problem, and at pretty high speeds too.  I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is   pretty standard.\",\" Bobby-  A few posts ago you said that Lucifer had no free will.

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  [deletions]   Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.    Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.  I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...    Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?    Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions]   My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn't help making a few nitpicks here and there. :->  Sincerely,\",\" That's a twin-cam, right?  There's a steel guard right next to the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the engine cases, and it's needed.  There's probably not enough room to fit a bigger sprocket.  I'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  If you raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at any given speed.

Generally, these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, for example, we have the following set regarding children:   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to   the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum   [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem   families and received as servants when they are left alone through   the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect   all such children in your province and send them to the places of   deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to   the people.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [1]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the   time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their   lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.      Minister of the Interior,       Talaat\\\" [2]   \\\"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.    November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the   orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their   places of exile.        Abdullahad Nuri. [3]    \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.    January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been   opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is   done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt   of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or   any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it   purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as   detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received   into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish   special orphanages for them.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat.\\\" [4]   \\\"To the Government of Aleppo.     Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures   to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with   the caravans.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [5]   \\\"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.    At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"   But you still get into trouble. For example - how often are crimes of violence not \\\"hate crimes\\\"? The question is then who are you hating? If its another gang member, then its better than if the person you hate is of a differnt color?   Also, is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse than crimes of gross negligence? (Like random drive by shootings where they can't be hate crimes because the shooter doesn't know who he is going to hit - he just shoots into the crowd).    First, I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead of New York is going after the bombers. This means no capital punishment.  Secondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after you for first one murder, then the next, etc. A \\\"sovereign\\\" has essentially one chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing). That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the deaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once. Of course, as we discovered in the Rodney King case, there are two \\\"sovereigns\\\", neither of which can try you twice for the same crime.\",\"...  I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop. The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device -- it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.\",\"YESSS!  You make me proud to be an 'Merkun.  Good thing you didn't get shot though. Don't try that with a good'ole boy in Texas. I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was  in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, \\\"Stick that finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your sorry-ass throat.\\\"  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him,  waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...

I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have.    However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The way I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation was just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)  Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs would finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)   These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective division.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now.  I wonder why.  Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is going to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the benefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the pennant is going to go to the West.

There is no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.  To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is getting adequate drug levels. \",\" Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.  Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus to \\\"seek and save that which was lost\\\" (Luke 19:10)?  You asked for it.  2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished. Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples \\\"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord\\\". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the \\\"fiery lake of burning sulfur\\\". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast \\\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\\\" and there being \\\"no rest day or night\\\" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  \\\"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.\\\"  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.   Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing \\\"devil's advocate\\\".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term \\\"second death\\\".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to  understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \\\"the second death\\\". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \\\"everlasting destruction\\\"? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that  there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.

He believed in a closed cannon.    Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \\\"M\\\" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \\\"He never prophesies anything good about me.\\\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his  lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an  apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.    So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it  Scripture.     I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with  prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also  similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \\\"And his bishoprick let another take\\\" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.    Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.   Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a  bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the  Spirit, and use them according to His leading.\",\"I am eager to hear the legal theory behind restricting exchange of cryptographic data and encrypted messages, given the first admendment; the theory behind regulating the *personal* encryption of one's personal *thoughts and feelings* seems even less tenable.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"UPDATED  LIST Hi everybody   I have the following books for sale.

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100% insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a different culture.   \\\"Managed Care\\\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says of HMO/NHS approaches, \\\"We left that behind with East Germany!\\\"). Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings.  In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked \\\"sickness funds\\\" over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)  With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.  gld\",\"hello testing   \",\"stuff deleted ...

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed. \",\"      Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.   I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.\",\"Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.  *** THIS IS LONG ***  I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded \\\"impact\\\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.

Would those work very well in stopping an attack?\",\" I think I have updated info on this.  My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an  investigation into the use of excessive force.    The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have  happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home  to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him.  A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into  Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the  3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.\",\" Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for \\\"high ground\\\" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.  Gary\",\" What does this have to do with my original question???

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\" Was that post for real?

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

Have any third-parties announced such a beast? \",\"  Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and  there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage.  The bishop of Natal, whose wife of many years had died, and who had recently  remarried, announced \\\"It MUST be consummated\\\" and looked like that cat that  got the cream.

I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but 500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. Can you picture Hitler, with Panzers and Focke-Wulfs poised on the border, losing sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman? Sure.  Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this world. We'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more rifles on the street. Let's disband the NRA and start a National Investment Banking Association, replete with red and black sticker for the back window of Bubba's Mercedes 600! We could fire Charlton Heston and get Paul Volcker for a spokesman. \",\" That's a revisionist account of what happened.  Gritz was well-aware of Duke's presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shy about associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.   I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with a photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke.\",\"       Yeah, do you expect people to read the FAQ, etc. and actually accept hard atheism?  No, you need a little leap of faith, Jimmy.  Your logic runs out of steam!        Jim,  Sorry I can't pity you, Jim.  And I'm sorry that you have these feelings of denial about the faith you need to get by.  Oh well, just pretend that it will all end happily ever after anyway.

Don't forget your Flintstone's Chewables!  :)  -- Bake Timmons, III\",\"    I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that  think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly  sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing danger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of \\\"distractions\\\" for me.        Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault, and I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber. But the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I was too stingy to put on my lights.         The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to  oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.        Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 200 million cars, it is miniscule!     Whatever.....  'tis a pity I have to share the same roads with a person not concerned with safety.  -S ssave@ole.cdac.com \",\"  Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.\",\"Well, it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall when this key escrow trial balloon was raised!

You do not have to have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own and operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make use of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.  So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or *manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good anywhere in the United States.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \\\"better\\\" - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe her.)\",\" All true.  And all good points.    Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.

The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically.  With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment.

Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....   I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....   Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....   Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.   Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around than magazines though.   True, but this is a training function.   Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for example are quite safe to carry this way.   Agreed.  Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem. An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.  I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.  Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight. The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall into that category.  Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \\\"The Semi Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\\\"  In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi auto effectively as a self defense arm.  Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.  For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!  That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok too!)  If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)\",\"I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is  often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs. In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is  disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed  solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth. It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant, and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation. I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon.    I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the  people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to imagine ????  It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc..... SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not  know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where an 8 year old girl just happened to be. We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is  the Israeli way of telling us that \\\"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers you're gonna pay the price\\\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young  men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers. Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING  ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real  leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw. The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a  regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that the so called \\\"Security Zone\\\" is necessary for the protection of  Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the  establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.  I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled. This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in.   If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw  unilaterally from the so-called \\\"Security Zone\\\" before the conclusion of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives, advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's  public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations  since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in  peace and has already offered some important concessions. Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not  accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it. There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such  circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.   I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make  Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians. The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an  occupying soldier is attacked.   \",\"  The gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape recorder.

We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion.   We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)).  God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/.  The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.

Regards, Vesselin\",\"Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:   I never thought of these two ideas being \\\"against\\\" each other. People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.  SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD  INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY  SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

Thanx\",\"    {Description of \\\"External Tank\\\" option for SSF redesign deleted}   Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the \\\"External Tank\\\" and \\\"Wingless Orbiter\\\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the \\\"giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,\\\" and building a \\\"station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\\\"  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option \\\"A\\\" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses \\\"Bus-1\\\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's      qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A \\\"Power Station Capability\\\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an \\\"arrow mode\\\" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option \\\"B\\\" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option \\\"B\\\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \\\"A\\\"). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A \\\"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\\\" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.\",\"  The only reason ESPN showed that hockey came was because there was no other baseball game scheduled for the evening.

Why would God discriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules.  God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the law.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can never be used as an instrument of salvation.

The number to dial is 211 for the same result. \",\" I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\" One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and noticed 2 out on the road.

Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated.

Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.  (stuff deleted)   And what if the original poster, Pixie, is never \\\"converted?\\\" Does it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity for that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many  Christians believe?  It makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no life for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best.    --------------------------------------------\",\"  I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment) than the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is  significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they are not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And  Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out, from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't their fault?

Eating of the tree of life would not take away the effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.

But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.

Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration, you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be.  Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government. You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying \\\"this is good because it gives people privacy\\\", note that we didn't need them to give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware right now.  Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.  They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a clipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize for having traded in your birthright.  And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from foreigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else and are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional terrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.

OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\" Unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  Promise the voters money, and they will vote for you.   Same here.  Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.   That you know of.  While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I left two years later, there were no clues.   Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is \\\"no big deal\\\" if you are the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail, waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very early.   Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a hatred that goes beyond reason.  Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational ones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun controls?   They did not believe, from experience, that the \\\"police\\\" (including National Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and also likely armed with stolen firearms?   Criminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for a less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.

So do you also oppose all ideologies?  I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, but just points out the weaknesses of human nature.   I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.   One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying \\\"For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward\\\" says they have souls.    (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then  I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.   Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be \\\"forgiven\\\" and \\\"rewarded\\\" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations  fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.\",\"  Agreed, but, yes, chapstick fits under the \\\"waxy shit\\\" category, although I've noticed that stealing Annette's chapstick (after she's applied it :-) kept my lips from cracking this past winter like they have in all previous winters.

I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my \\\"weak\\\" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.

No, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.     That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.

It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is  not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications. As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

Thanks, Fred\",\" Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern, found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.  Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.  Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas.  Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle.  They remember being \\\"relocated\\\" by the US Army, and don't intend to do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers. \",\"       Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators of crimes no more represent the \\\"Black community\\\" than racist hateful Whites represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.  For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race, and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define \\\"us\\\" and \\\"other\\\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans.  It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \\\"ethnic diversity\\\". Here, we have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \\\"model minority\\\") gangs, and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear. During the \\\"disturbance\\\" in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly multi-ethnic riot.

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use \\\"slower\\\" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

(audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors, specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z\\\"l).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave \\\"gifts\\\" (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.  So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture, your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.

If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a  modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all  O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of  the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier  requirements.  2.

My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber \\\"parking lights\\\", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white \\\"cornering lamps\\\" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white \\\"backup lights\\\" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.

Guy\",\" [ description of experiment deleted ]   [ more deleted ]   A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no visible contrast bands.  To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254, etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.  Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.

Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might).

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\" Do you have the specs for this monitor?  What have they changed from the F550i?

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.  I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better buckle down.\",\"A friend's daughter has been diagnosed with an eye disease called \\\"Star Gartds\\\" (or something close) - it is apparently genetic, according to her, and affects every fourth generation.

SURVEY:  Question 1) Have you ever had trouble reconciling faith and reason? If so, what was the trouble? (For example: -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism                holds more truth?               -Do you practice tarot cards, palm readings, or divination that                conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world?               -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that                you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you?) Basically, we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your _REASON_tells you is wrong.  Question 2) If you have had conflict, how did/do you resolve the conflict?  Question 3) If you haven't had trouble, why do you think you haven't? Is there a set of guidelines you use for solving these problems?

Support you local micro-brewery.\\\" -me\",\"  If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \\\"go ballistic\\\", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"      Sure.

Bussard, Journal of  Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990       Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion      systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the      thrust-power \\\"gain\\\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values      of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are      always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \\\"high-thrust\\\"      interplanetary flight is not possible, because system      acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local      gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100      times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer      \\\"high-thrust\\\" flight capability. One performance example shows a      53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with      19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows      the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in      Earth/moon space.   \\\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for  Aerospace Flight Propulsion\\\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion  Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.       Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron      flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times      larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma      pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds      could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities      and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and      other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm      innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure      efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically      compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power      conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens      of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the      multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages      indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I      strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob      Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently      declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one      of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather      than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the      PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid      MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION DRIVES:   Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE  archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the  SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in  the 1960s and 70s.

No one suggests that :such analysis should be left to \\\"regulators.\\\"  In fact, the \\\"re-inventing :government\\\" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the :analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more :about it.     Okay,  let me try to explain this.  When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President, one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted. I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations, the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation, combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision with respect to specific regulations.      :Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only \\\"feasible\\\" approach.  What is :not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and  :licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent :tasks.  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"feasible\\\" in this case.  Do you mean that [] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in fact?   :Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as  :generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.  2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be responsible to make their own decisions as adults are.  :(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to :be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending :that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)  You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt  with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to the state are the coersive ones.  :Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries :frequently generate support by acting as protectors of \\\"geezers,\\\"  :mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds :that \\\"we don't have much to fear\\\" from them do so at their own peril.  Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more  likely to be worse off during and after a revolution than before.  In the unlikely event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly: The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered \\\"defense\\\" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously dispute this?    I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.

Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"Hi!

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy device.

Therefore, you choose to punish only those who _talk_ about it.  \",\"There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and I suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.   *  For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity. (Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the Masons.)  The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department, which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality. However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the feeling that they were saying \\\"You got the wrong answer last time, try to do better and get the answer we want.\\\")  Anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but the dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it, but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things such as: \\\"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\\\"  The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well- known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings of Masonry are \\\"supportive of Christian faith and practice\\\".  Examples of the latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.  On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible with Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they are not meant seriously), the \\\"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\\\" writings of some Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many Masonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)   The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals. This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges, and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may not.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably influenced how the report came out.   *  The information above was gleaned from \\\"The Religious Herald\\\", a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \\\"Baptists Today\\\", which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a big issue among some Baptists.  8-)  Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.

Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic\",\"  I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read?  Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.   Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation.\",\"Well, there *is* a difference.  I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\"It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system' and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all sufferers.  This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals. Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their story all over the world?  As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for future sufferers.)\",\"============================================================================== Bear with me i'm new at this game, but could anyone explain exactly what DMORF does, does it simply fade one bitmap into another or does it re shape one bitma p into another.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \\\"two-call\\\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.   If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call 713-279-1066.     --  Jaclyn Brandt jbrandt@NeoSoft.com\",\" Interesting, I'd like to know why.

This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory.  Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making  cards to fit in the other two.   How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.

Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine. Jerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.   Not so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable by showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that God exists. Simple.  I missed your \\\"Traditional Proofs\\\" treatise, but the proofs I remember from the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor stuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.  I would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of. (I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and the Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names, anyway.)   This is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists. Otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.   Please show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause argument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there is a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices questionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes that the First Cause is God.   Got it. I deny that God is all good. So there.   This isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship, then God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is human. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating: The intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.   Why?  Also, why assume said claim is true anyway?  If *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?   :)  Undoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the Marines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and that the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying, as I have missed it.   Why? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong.  You assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But I assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth. How is it my assertion is less good than yours?   Oh?  I hereby deny 1+1=2.  I hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.  Granted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that, but I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.  Now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious net outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.   They are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always works in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.  Science is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't, we'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more: If you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things you Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.   Even presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may not be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows that God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must be obeyed!

Mike Ruff\",\"  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists \\\"believe\\\" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.

If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\" Don't listen to this guy, he's just a crank.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.  OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.  I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain. In scenario (b), who pays the bill?\",\"Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part01 Last-modified: 1993/4/15   FAQ for sci.crypt, part 1: Overview  This is the first of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ.

PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  \\\"Galactic Pot-Healer\\\" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  \\\"A Maze of Death\\\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  \\\"VALIS\\\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  \\\"The Divine Invasion\\\" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it \\\"right\\\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \\\"old world\\\" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  \\\"The Bible\\\" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  \\\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\\\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \\\"The Coherence of Theism\\\" (1977) and was concluded with \\\"Faith and Reason\\\" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\".  In the revised edition of \\\"The Existence of God\\\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \\\"replacements for God\\\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.

I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the \\\"Apologists\\\".  Their theology has often been described as \\\"Logos theology\\\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This \\\"immanent Word\\\" became \\\"expressed\\\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the \\\"economy\\\").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should probably be called \\\"economic trinitarianism\\\", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism   Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end.  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism   Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting \\\"three in oneness\\\" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [I've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  \\\"Economic\\\" Trinitarianism   Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various \\\"neo-economic\\\" Trinitarians Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as \\\"distinction\\\" and \\\"distribution\\\" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \\\"eternally generated\\\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that \\\"there was once when he was not\\\" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate \\\"hypostases\\\", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (\\\"of the same substance\\\").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]   Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \\\"Threeness in oneness\\\" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence.  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox Trinitarianism   Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \\\"undivided in divided persons.\\\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of \\\"three in oneness.\\\" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.  I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;    2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps.

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying  entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure.  Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses (that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are  inherently in conflict.  Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present policies towards Gazan residents.

(The remains are on public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and the discoveries made with the instrument.  Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by mail order.

Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd \\\"office of the GM\\\". And a 4th is likely to happen before September; they'll either add the new coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the Panther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.  Given the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and the reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton, and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh did, but they needed a quarter century.\",\"Accounts of Anti-Armenian Human Right Violations in Azerbaijan #012                  Prelude to Current Events in Nagorno-Karabakh          +---------------------------------------------------------+         |                                                         |         |  I saw a naked girl with her hair down.

I moved there from Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is Arutunian, my husband's name . . .  That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints  and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the  Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past  year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because  I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be  involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they  told me, \\\"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for  this kind of work.\\\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at  the Armenians, like \\\"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\\\" and \\\"Things  will be just fine if we get rid of them all.\\\" \\\"No problem, the Turks will  help,\\\" they say, \\\"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an  hour.\\\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it  would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it.  Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one  even considered such an idea possible.  But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative  people I would often ask, \\\"Where is this all leading, do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait,  there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going on?\\\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that  everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of  it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I  hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were  under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade.  The women told me, \\\"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\\\" I didn't  believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that  they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \\\"Are you the First  Secretary of our City Party Committee?\\\" He answers me, \\\"Yes.\\\" And I ask him,  \\\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani  flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know  exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\\\" And he tells me, \\\"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\\\" Then I asked him another question: \\\"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering  us? And he said, \\\"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't  anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\\\"  Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the  Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \\\"No, we actually didn't  anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain  the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\\\" Those are his  exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR.  And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them,  because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors  concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't.  But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so  horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really  a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.  For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my  husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on  the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \\\"You're in bed? You don't  know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they  were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars  and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they  turned the car over and burned it.\\\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was  returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my  neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the  middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they  were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and  I said, \\\"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\\\" And she said,  \\\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw  that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \\\"Don't break  the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want. \\\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians  although he's an Azerbaijani.  While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say, \\\"Look, there's a crowd out  there.\\\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had  already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian  family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I  don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my  husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3.  There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things  were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once  wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they  beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing  the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on  television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell  us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't  have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the  Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.  At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there,  and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly  off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down  there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At  first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband,  \\\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\\\" And he answered, \\\"I  don't know, could be.\\\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw  it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way,  he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging  her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell  down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their  balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of  blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two  from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.  Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman, because I had just seen that.  I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \\\"You kill me first, and then  let them do what they want with the corpse.\\\" But our neighbors, it's true,  defended us, they said, \\\"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away,  only Muslims live here.\\\" Disaster missed us that time.  But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately,  came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's  upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to  balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as  though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever,  and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look  and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first  time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the  morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the  Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them  too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went  toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you  could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke  Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" And  they answered, \\\"We want the Armenian family that lives here\\\" [pointing toward  the second floor with their hands]. She says, \\\"I already told you, we don't  have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman  talking to you,\\\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they  seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing  and left. That was the second time death was at our door.  I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there,  I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we  really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth  floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight  months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to  earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture  and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas, everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything  out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on  the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that  hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means  that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to  be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been  foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of  apartments. Something on the order of \\\"We'll move the Armenians out and take  over their apartments.\\\"  I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I  came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the  Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I  knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in  Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was  bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were  no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw  all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.  I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they  had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some  Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with  the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on  the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure  people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for  the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But  having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having  thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people.  If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed,  and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to  calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute, \\\"Go and announce it on television:  Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our  neighbors from this massacre?\\\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no  controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms,  mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature  shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we  noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were  brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was  saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend  us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do  it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik,  what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out! The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things  I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They  were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one  o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8.  When they returned to our building I told my husband, \\\"Lendrush, now the  police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably  going to find out and come to our aid.\\\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no  authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single  ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out, beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments, and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned,  it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in  Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they  attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and  from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers,  wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against  that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using  stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have  guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under  the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under  Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get  involved.  If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five  years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered  me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a  Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property, or the property of some magnate, or some \\\"mafia\\\": If I want to, I'll get you  out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do  something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most  brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had  the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid, I heard with my own ears: \\\"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so  instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything  will go fine for you.\\\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I  do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless. And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed  it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got  involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to  the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony  about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know  if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer  believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all  dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most  important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in  you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...  I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example. Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy, Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail: When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in  Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments. But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call  anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap  their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.  Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class.  According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to his mother and said, \\\"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow. . . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\\\" His  mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \\\"Valery, you can't go because  I am afraid.\\\" He says, \\\"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch,  just have a look.\\\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a  superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken  everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian  apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that  the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows  in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and  Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already  been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks  ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we  left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to  Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this  straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit  them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in  a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being  kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought  there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .  When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another,  throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if  these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.  If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of  things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped  were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying,  that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \\\"What happened?\\\" and she  bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . .  those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that  I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.  Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided, well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny, some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .  Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who  don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when  I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are  not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they  were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a  single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan  all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack  anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are  guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it  seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \\\"Did  you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31  people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an  Armenian?\\\"  Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee. When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I  couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \\\"Why  did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at  these women who are strewn about on the floor?\\\" The overcrowding there was  tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They  cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but  the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at  it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they  were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait,  was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored  personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart  advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.  But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically,  tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the hand and said, \\\"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office. I told him, \\\"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of  what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the  traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \\\" Oh  yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even  very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice,  expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \\\"Oh, why  did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume, you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at them?\\\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who  he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head  and hid it. Then I said, \\\"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We  didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\\\" \\\"Well kill me, kill me!\\\"  Muslimzade says to me, \\\"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not guilty.\\\" And I say, \\\"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give  us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and  raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things,  carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you  then?\\\" \\\"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't  anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\\\" I started  laughing and said, \\\"It's truly funny.\\\" He says, \\\"What could I do? We didn't  know what to do.\\\" And I say, \\\"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell  you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in  front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross  over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was  during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself; either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran  away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid,  excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you,  you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done?  That's right,\\\" I told him, \\\"the City party committee got confused, all the  party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused,  they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with  impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two  days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would  have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some  Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told  them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\\\"  And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We  asked him, \\\"What? How? What will come of us?\\\" He openly said, \\\"You know, for  us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\\\" The  General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all  cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because  the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke; as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When  he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit,  by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it,  because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen,  and he said, \\\"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely  punished, in accordance with our laws.\\\" And that's a quote. Then one mother  throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says, \\\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\\\" They tried  to calm her down, and he said, \\\"In order for us to conduct a proper  investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you  must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang  who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe  someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that  you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having  lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth  about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge  later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you  can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The  names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is  necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening  gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put  the information into the urn.\\\"  Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people,  people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she  came up and said, \\\"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as  will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you  please write it down for me.\\\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if  it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that  information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply  can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example,  should someone say that black is white if it is really black?     The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council  of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the  one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their  previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him,  and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very  politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and  when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \\\"Where were you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to  return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where  it was all leading?\\\" he says, \\\"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince  words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell  you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole  government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about  45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its  fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting  it?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it  in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \\\" I say, \\\"Fine,  you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have  known. Why did no one help us?\\\" And he says, \\\"Well, OK, we didn't know what to do\\\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from  Muslimzade. Later, when he said, \\\"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is  favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the  Azerbaijanis . . . \\\" To this l answered, \\\"You know what . . . I'm speaking  with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with  Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me,  please, Comrade Mamedov, \\\" I asked him, \\\"What would you say about this honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\\\" Then he said, \\\"Yes, I  admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we  have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before  the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign  radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\\\" And I say, \\\"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's possible to add anything more awful.\\\" He says, \\\"Yes, I agree with you, I  understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\\\" I repeat that he said \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what  he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously-- and said, \\\"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \\\" I take this to mean that  he really thinks it's an \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" \\\"And of course,\\\" he says,  \\\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait,  but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being  tried.\\\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not,  that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody  affair.  Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an  Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \\\"What, they didn't nail your husband? They screwed up.\\\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from  February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \\\"I don't know,  Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't  put it down as unexcused absence.\\\" I was really discouraged by this. They all  know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here  they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying  myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a  Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and  said, \\\"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \\\" He looked at me askance and said, \\\"And why are you\\\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\\\"why did you get wrapped up in this mess?\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean, why did I get  wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\\\" I tell him, \\\"I have an  Armenian last name.\\\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as  though he had eaten something sour, and said, \\\"I didn't expect that you would . . . \\\" What did he mean by that? And \\\"how\\\" should he behave, the chief of the pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a  reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And  if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what  can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?! He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this,  the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .  By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked  him \\\"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return  to Sumgait?\\\" he answered, \\\"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I  won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\\\" I say, \\\"So you've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then  in another 50 years it'll happen again?!\\\" I couldn't contain myself any more, and I also told him, \\\"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in  Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did  everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the  way you treated them?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, you're finally starting to  insult me!\\\" He threw his pen on the desk. \\\"Maybe now you'll say I'm a  scoundrel too?\\\" I say, \\\"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't  know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that  comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain. \\\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors,  that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had  gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good.  \\\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of  the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of  Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait.\\\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, ' \\\"Well, I walked down the street.\\\" And I said, \\\"Walking down the street in any  city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you  spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't  know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd  hear something quite different.\\\" I told him, for example, that I drew my  conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the  neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I  thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier  accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything  there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young  people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they  were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and  tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when  the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they  withdraw protection from the city altogether?

Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but  since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn.       Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't  make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per- car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.    Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is drawing near. Look up!\",\" My own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom is a good thing.

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.\",\"  No, it is independent of the speedometer.

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it \\\"infallibilism\\\".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.\",\"JL> From: jlecher@pbs.org JL> > I would not classify a mild headache that was continuous for weeks JL> > as migraine, even if the other typical features were there (e.g., JL> > unilateral, nausea and vomiting, photophobia).

Helsingfors IFK have been around since 1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think you're exagerating here.   That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:  (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player)  FINLAND:    D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)  SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \\\"dynasty\\\" talk isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmonton's \\\"dynasty\\\" crumbled in the late '80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.  \",\"Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of those car hunters?

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?        I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I        erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.  From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect and smart Erase) don't use each others info. I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and I don't see any conflicts;  FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2        Norton Util's version 6\",\" That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a \\\"bingo card\\\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \\\"23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors.\\\" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the \\\"literature collectors\\\" from the serious potential customers.  \\\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\\\"  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really \\\"qualified\\\" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call. \",\" True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.  Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule today.  But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge, \\\"Hey, can we have permission to listen to those tapes?\\\" can they?   Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the really smart crooks anyway.

They like this enough that they are dropping the so called \\\"Digital Telephony\\\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.\",\"    There is a library of map projections in:      charon.er.usgs.gov  in\",\"   I'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year w/o any bike experience thus far.

Wierd dream, I wonder what it means....\",\"jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:     Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not    be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be    local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill    AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.    High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but    the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun    - and would pay through the nose for it.  Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude, homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns.  Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible. The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing, hand tools and a welder.  I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I think the demand for \\\"real\\\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have firearms, and \\\"bad guys\\\" will continue to have access to them, one way or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.\",\"  I wouldn't bet on it.  Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home. They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants.  Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.  You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less. \",\"As an additional data point, I have run Castrol 20W50 exclusively in the following cars: 75 Rabbit, 78 Scirocco, 76 Rabbit, 78 Bus, 70 Beetle, 76 Bus, 86 Jetta GLI.

Marty McInnis (NYI) 56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%) Igor Kravchuk (EDM) 55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)  These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off in PIM.

If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest \\\"imperfection\\\" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.

Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.   : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.    Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed \\\"degeneration\\\"?   I can understand Scott's reaction:  : > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be : > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what  : > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME : > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!   :  : In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you. : You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you : cannot *know* that.  I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more \\\"complex\\\", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing \\\"evil\\\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are \\\"meant\\\" (presumably by God) \\\"to be : punished by getting diseases\\\".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a \\\"why behind\\\"? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

How about within Iran?\",\"I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.  I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request, and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective.  The doctor called me back, and his first words were, \\\"Whatever you want, you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit- chat with you!\\\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I  then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded, \\\"Just spit it out now because no time is a good time.\\\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said \\\"well, never mind\\\" and he said he'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.  This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't express myself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesn't have time to \\\"rap with patients\\\" and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to \\\"rap\\\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he  felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me this apology: \\\"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot of time to deal with that.\\\"  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.  I am still upset and have not yet called.  My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care? (2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him.\",\" I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members.

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, including:  X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.
