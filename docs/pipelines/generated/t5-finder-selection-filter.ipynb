Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.  The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.

According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,   we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10   times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of   1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as   dramatically.      When standards of living, population densities, and industrial   structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy   efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group   of Seven nations.      Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil   price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the   cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,   even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the   overall U.S. economy.      Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per   $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.      Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side   management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource   inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not   reduce demand.      Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes   unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that   subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,   gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood   of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state   at the expense of the individual.      \\\"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\\\" is no.   189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an   independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.    Available from:   Cato Institute   224 Second Street SE   Washington, DC  20003    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             The Cato Institute      Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research   foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate   to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the   traditional American principles of limited government, individual   liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve   greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in    questions of policy and the proper role of government.     The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets   that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th   century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation   of the American Revolution.     Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually   no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive   intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary   intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for   civil liberties.     To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive   publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy   issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned   to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military   spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy   conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are   published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.     In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts   no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,   corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from   the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,   educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue   Code.\",\"Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging after the installation of DOS 6?

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\" You said it worked so well with tobacco.

The kind of thing you're  looking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff. Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind  of thing.    Hope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though. \",\"      You know, I never really appreciated them before!  \",\"As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president. After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as  persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price  information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National  Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  \\\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\\\" Torrey said.   \\\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\\\"  More BIO: In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.  \\\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\\\", said Torrey, 58, a native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm Beach.

I'm not an objectivist, so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization.  The problem in this case is at least as bad as that of trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary experience.  One can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the perspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).  An analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is that the \\\"better\\\" descriptive language is not available.   This word \\\"reliable\\\" is essentially meaningless in the context-- unless you can show how reliability can be determined.\",\"1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position.  2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion.  Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:  ------10K--------+---------? ohm ----                  | Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T. (loaded)         | -----------------+-------------------  Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the millivolt test generator you want.  Good luck,  \",\"Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....      I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.     If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program, it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):           * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )          * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:                                 This is a car, not an electron.          *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be                                         electrical noise or contact bounce      As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).      I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all, a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this in good detail.                                 - Jerry Kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com ) \",\" Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen), you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for an antisatellite weapon... :-)  The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly 100km.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost  identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.    *** If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to  ***  *** be added to the xpert mailing list.   ***   Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information  electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to  xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address.    The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of  standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT  carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already  receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing  list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to  subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only  redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal  addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail  administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.    comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.   In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:   bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions   x-ada           X and ada   x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics   ximage          people interested in image processing and X   xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X  To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your  organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request \\\"addition request\\\".

GXUGiV is the German X User's Group in Vorbereitung (\\\"in preparation\\\") being formed for X programmers and users; it is associated with the EXUG. All interested should contact Olaf Heimburger (+49 30 7 79 54 64; and at mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   6)  What related FAQs are available?   Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts a FAQ on Open Look to  comp.windows.open-look.    Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts a FAQ on Motif to  comp.windows.x.motif.  Peter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts a FAQ for comp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.  Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ on  maximizing the performance of X.  Steve Kotsopoulos (steve@ecf.toronto.edu) posts to comp.windows.x a FAQ about using X on Intel-based Unix systems.  The FAQ in alt.binaries.pictures contains information on viewing images with X and on massaging image formats.

There exists a PEX/PHiGS FAQ.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?   When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include  all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.   Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.   Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?   The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:   - O'Reilly and Associates publishes \\\"The X Resource: A Practical  Journal of the X Window System\\\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).   Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.   - The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a  variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber  Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial  information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?   Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which  provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \\\"Xt-based\\\"  program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses  Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.  Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions useful in building various applications and widgets.  Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set distributed with X11 source.  Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary kits are available from many hardware vendors.  Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++,  but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.  CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.  XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for  a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.  XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they can query and access those resources.  RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \\\"please locate and consult the  relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\\\".  UTSL: A common expression meaning \\\"take advantage of the fact that you  aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\\\".  API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in a programming library.  BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled X fonts.  GUI: graphical user interface.  UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets  programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \\\"outline\\\" form  WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the  understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and  actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file  GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0  UIMS: User Interface Management System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)   The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either:  - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT  - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \\\"X Window System\\\" book  - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \\\"X Protocol Reference Manual.\\\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]   - the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \\\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\\\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.   Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \\\"RTFM\\\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?   The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.  MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).  Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.  Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.  Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.  [For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4 distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?   OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.    OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \\\"virtual toolkit\\\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.   OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.  [Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?   Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system  that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface  specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).  [thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?   DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?   PEX is the \\\"PHiGS Extension to X\\\".  PHiGS stands for \\\"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\\\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics.  Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \\\"low-bandwidth X\\\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \\\"proxy\\\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1) You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't   otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly   connected), and    (2) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that  have to cross the serial interface, and    (3) In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering   packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for   blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]   There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?   The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):   wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3  uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.  twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.   awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers  cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.   rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.  dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering  hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm  mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit  tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering   olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality  olwm (AT&T): ditto  gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]  m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape  pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release  swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file  twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape  vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92]  tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers  olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.  mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].  NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look   XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals   ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.  vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM  piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?   It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:   exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?   Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \\\"xplaces\\\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90]  Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?   DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:  sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?   You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \\\"xset r on|off\\\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems.  Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \\\"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\\\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?   There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \\\"macro expansion.\\\"  Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as:  xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\\   <Key>F1: string(\\\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\\\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\\\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include.  Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \\\"remapper\\\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);   Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.

Sue\",\"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

The ibm shuttle groups was the *only* one at level 5! \",\"   This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the   belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.  This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are  conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have  to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe  in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at  God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan  except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond  hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The   reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians  have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.    How did they shoot themselves in the foot?     There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a    particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and   then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least   an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this   viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because   one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the   russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict   your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant   to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists   can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).      Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist  doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may  just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:    Strong atheism - \\\"I believe god does not exist\\\"   a positive belief   Weak atheism   - \\\"I don't believe in a god\\\"       a negative belief    these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of  god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that  you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)    suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent  as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas  exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person  not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that  even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:    christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god    atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)    atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set    agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)      Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not   will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always    prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival   trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.  \",\" Well, the first 2 are easy.

It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\" In the U\\bIBM PC world, how much of a \\\"standard\\\" has VESA become for SVGA graphics?

While I'll agree that these are generally held to be \\\"good things\\\", I question whether they come very close to being objective values. Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable.  I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally \\\"good\\\" or \\\"bad\\\".  And when I referred to \\\"the truth\\\" I was using the term hypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing.   True enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than personal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \\\"higher authority\\\" (aka, absolute moral truth).   An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\" Doug> NNTP-Posting-Host: se05.wg2.waii.com I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 1.2.1 (the  one  bundled  with  AIX  3.2.3e).

It looks like that would have been a problem.  Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike (Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the  Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we  should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even  worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence  zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the  city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right. As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles.  \",\" A book that I can somewhat recommend is :                                            Pratical Image Processing in C                      by Craig A.

Corbett,  ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's  idea, right?)\",\"... ...  Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.   Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.   Definitely!   No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious  places where they screwed up.   Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \\\"credit card\\\" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))   The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.   I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically sound.  ...  Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it, but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly suggest looking into the MX-6.   The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of  head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints, so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to  give them a place to put their feet.   The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!   I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.  Hope this helps,  -chuck-\",\" This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'.

Again, I don't expect sales people to   bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be   abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to   me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales   cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue   to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are   easy to intimidate.  On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'   approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed   price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework   before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable   profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to   it. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you   after the deal is agreed on.\",\" The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in  exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an  endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird  cross between a libertarian and an \\\"establishment tool\\\" is that I end up  taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when  the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my  lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.    As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government  to be \\\"fair\\\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,  whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the  government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.   What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,  so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)  sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth  it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its  citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the  major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a  couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it  would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I  agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly  participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a  strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.   I've already written off politics.  And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive  faster than 55 MPH, too. \",\"   As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  \\\"multi-headed\\\" tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg, a Sun with a cg4 display).  \\\"multi-screen\\\" and \\\"multi-display\\\" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of \\\"multi-display\\\" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing \\\"multi-screen\\\" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.  \\\"zaphod\\\" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen.   There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.  What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X.       der Mouse\",\"---------- cut here ---------- part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

For example, incorrect English constructs such as \\\"its raining\\\" or \\\"it's window id\\\" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that \\\"color\\\" is more or less correct than \\\"colour\\\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as \\\"XAllocColor\\\" and \\\"colormap\\\".  In a world that uses the term \\\"Windows\\\" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept \\\"X Windows\\\" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, \\\"the X Window System\\\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (\\\"X\\\" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called \\\"Microsoft Windows\\\" or \\\"the Microsoft Window System\\\" or how about just plain \\\"Microsoft\\\"!  To summarise (or should that be \\\"summarize\\\") the point of this message: I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be \\\"windowing system\\\"). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System. \",\"  ------------ Part 10 of 14 ------------ M:J\\\"U$$,^UM[>WE/M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXOM[>U34U-34[\\\"PL!D9<7'2TM+2 M/3T]/3T]F9F9`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`$!`0&$`0%XGG5UP,#`P%M;%*JJJFMK\\\"0G/S\\\\_/SPD)-C9N MV=E&!UDS4G9V4I5960<'$=G9V=G9V=EN;FYN;FYN;F[9V=EA86%A!05L;&QL M!04%>7F3DV-CDY.3DY-C555555555555555L;&QL$A(2$A(2;&QL556TM!$1 M[NXV-C8)J@F`\\\"6L\\\";MD1$3,S4G83$W924I4S,S,S$1$163,SE5)V=G9V4@$!

Does anone have any information  I'm not sure that this condition is \\\"recognised\\\" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these \\\"acute\\\" changes in a \\\"chronic\\\" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints).\",\"  True (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).     Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more battery power.     Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.\",\"  Not to pick on Mr. May in particular, of course, but isn't this kind of the domino theory?

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.  ----------- End included article -----------  \",\" Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to  serial port weirdness.

The three problems I see are:    1) The colormap, though huge, is static.   2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.   3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the      translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.

The   corollary is that the Hezbollah are the White Hats, and that   whatever they do is a Good Thing, and the Israelis only prove   themselves to be Bad Guys by attacking them.    This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know, who cheers   when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently   rearrange an opponent's face, and curses the ref for penalizing   His Side.  Of course, when it's different when the roles are   reversed.\",\"Paul Prescod pontificating:    PP>>     Libertarians oppose BOTH waiting periods AND background checks  PP>>-- or ANY prerequisite for exercising rights that are supposed to  PP>>be guaranteed.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.

The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season,  announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for  their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.   The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it  wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last  home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must  pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992,  which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take  property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine. **   Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL,  allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two  regular-season games.

New Jersey Devils **   Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis  Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After  the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to  compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East  Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor  league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning. **   As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that  the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the  Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning  general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that  the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are  exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  \\\"We were disappointed  with ESPN's irresponsible comment,\\\" Esposito said.  \\\"There is just no  substance to the rumor.\\\" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft news:          Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.

San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League news:  Disputes:    The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of  the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New  Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.         According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams  playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have  been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit,  Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto  and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.         Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its  rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''         Boe said league play will have an international flair and  discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the  IIHF.         ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and  eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.         The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.  -----   - British Premier Division:    contacts:   Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:    Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?  A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in  and around Montreal. Hence they were called \\\"Les Habitants\\\" (natives of  Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.    Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?  A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to  signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer  existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.   Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?  A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is  a weekly journal with up-to-date info. Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US) Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)    Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in  the NHL?  A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1  chances.    Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?  A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when  a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a  +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short- handed goals do count for +/-.    Q: What is the five-hole?  A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones:  (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower  right, and (5) five-hole.    Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?  A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven  series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a  game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.   Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?  A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever  to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for  the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis  Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat  Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine  shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately  lost the game, 6-4.   Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?  A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed  the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be  worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7  million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.   Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?  A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National  Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey  League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as  assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in  September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell  University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.   Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?  A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and  Colonial Hockey Leagues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------   9.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.

Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.  If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code, study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens.  Read \\\"Fight Your Ticket\\\" too, but don't miss the little section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're basically screwed.  As you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in California.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and revealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with the maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying his own cases.  So here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic school if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer can present the exact same case as you, the difference is the sentence.\",\"  You can try defraging your disk more often. It definitely will  help speed things up.

Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return   memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does   not shrink).    Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.

Regards, Vesselin\",\"Secrecy in Clipper Chip  The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message.  Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\" The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested is because that's what the ICCCM says they should do.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".

Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.   This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.   Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively  than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?  What practical  difference can this make?\",\"  Wow, you're quicker to point out heresy than the Church in the Middle ages. Seriously though, even the Sheiks at Al-Azhar don't claim that the Shi'ites are heretics. Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs).

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.

How is this done?  I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.  Alternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the \\\"right\\\" way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus policy is pointer.\",\" Depends on what you mean by \\\"for a living\\\".  1974 was the year he led the league in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs earlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 PH ABs early in his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the peak years.

Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick  scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!  As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!  As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli??

Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I've often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some \\\"Creator\\\"      was behind the universe's existence.  I've      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I've known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they've kept this belief in some form of higher      \\\"being.\\\"  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      \\\"truth\\\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its \\\"truth\\\"      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the \\\"right\\\" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with \\\"mystery.\\\"      Circular arguments, \\\"self-evdent\\\" facts and      \\\"truths,\\\" unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he's been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with \\\"mythical gods\\\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God's existence and question it impartially?

Beth\",\"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend \\\"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\\\"  It adds that \\\"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\\\"Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \\\"We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.\\\"  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with \\\"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church\\\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of \\\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\\\" which is entitled \\\"Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise\\\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: \\\"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.\\\"  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to      The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:\",\" First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors, transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an \\\"air core resonant transformer\\\". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called \\\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\\\" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication.

If you are uninterested, since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them.  I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.  Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...  #1 BRIAN HAYWARD  Season: 11th Acquired: '91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  P (D)  It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and '89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.  But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.  #30 JEFF HACKETT  Season: 3rd Acquired: '91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade:  C  Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles, almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next year.  #31 WADE FLAHERTY  Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie) Acquired: '91-92, signed as undrafted free agent Grade:  I (A-)  It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he may not ever.  #32 ARTURS IRBE  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B+  I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\"  Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior. A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying \\\"Lord, Lord,\\\" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent. But people should be careful not to think, \\\"God has given me a gift of the Spirit, it must be okay to be gay.\\\"  That is dangerous (see also hebrews 6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of  the world to come.)   Jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves out of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our nature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the morality that God has set forth.    If you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant, then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's. Is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the homosexual's or the one considered \\\"ignorant?\\\"\",\"I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC.

But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before \\\"the night of the long knives\\\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called \\\"Homosexuals in History\\\" asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.   Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \\\"knight of the long knives\\\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \\\"evils\\\" of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\",\"I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in   Baltimore on Saturday, July 31st.

This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.   The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.   There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate  the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or \\\"Progress is  the natural consequence of Human activity\\\" or \\\"parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government\\\", however  they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist.  \\\"We are a atheist society\\\" in fact means \\\"we reject the din other than ours\\\".   Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.   I think it took more than one minute.\",\"Hi,  I am looking for a PC card which does european videotext/teletext descrambling (PAL). Does anyone in the US sell such a card?

The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs. If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it. Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket) you can just detach and stow the pants.   One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better.   Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address   sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and  version updates provided without delay.        Performance Tested    CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.      A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)     IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE.

At least, Marvin's friend has not been able to : locate one and neither have I.  What is the fundamental reason for : this?  I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides  SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers. SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit},  and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.  The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the \\\"20% faster then IDE\\\" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.\",\"Amazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are not machines.

And  if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam, how  subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while  they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster move:  Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill  Injuries:  Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game Summary:  I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by a few things I did pick up:  First Period:  Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51  Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43  Second Period:  Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00  Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09  Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50  Third Period:  Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)  Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11  Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30  Overtime:  Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None  Power Play:  Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4  Goalies:  Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)  Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.

They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

Automation is more 'efficient' although by what scale they are not saying...\",\" The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.  Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March).  Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.   For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.  Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.   Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care.  At that point, they wouldn't even consider a \\\"voucher\\\" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.   It is \\\"free\\\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda.  The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer  1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For  1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.   Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.  When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan.  gld\",\"Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?  Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated.

The second question is something that's been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.

I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"\",\"   Hm, do you think Dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the NHL?

These pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.  On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter, which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)  \",\"I have a Fostex X-26 4-Track Recorder for sale.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.

Thanks in advance.\",\"    It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, \\\"The Bible, the Qur'an and Science\\\") for in general his translations are more literal.   Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as   \\\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\\\"  (Also note that \\\"the celestial bodies\\\" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)    You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a \\\"Dr.\\\") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)\",\"Actually, with several sharware utilities, you cn change both.

Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.  euclid \",\" The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.

Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!

The second goal came on a deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The third goal was EN.  No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen. \",\" Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and  undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.   Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred.   Can you spell \\\"loss leader?\\\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader  for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.    But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide  comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had  risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.  There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD  substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers  are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.   (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)    The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government  intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \\\"government bureaucracy\\\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account.  jsh \",\" I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc.

If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year.

Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \\\"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\\\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\" I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.

This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (\\\"not my will, Lord, but yours\\\") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.   It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.    Right, intentional will.  (Just like the Jewish people  We know neither the time nor the place.

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend:  Corpus Christi - W 12st St.  Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy,   St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \\\"clean\\\", largely gay  Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.  Happy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\",\"I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to \\\"please hurry it up\\\" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and \\\"marriage\\\" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.          I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?  \",\"There are actually only two of us.

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy  a bunch of their stuff :).  One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of  security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems. This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to  deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you  look at it :).   Great!  Where can I buy it?  Another note: If \\\"Clipper\\\" increases the incentive to bring stronger  encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at  the moment.   I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it  from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.    You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a  restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making  cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.   Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.

364-2290     15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA       LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.   ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier. The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.

[AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\" OK, I should have read the thread before posting my own $0.02.  I would just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (\\\"...nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...\\\"). Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection. Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as  to the location of the child--this is routine.  A \\\"computer crime\\\"  prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,  where a suit by a party injured by \\\"hackers\\\" would not.  If I am accused,  for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should  protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however, it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a \\\"crime\\\" in the technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how this would work out.

It just might be a bad idea for them, too.  OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they now need to      (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of        the key.  Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics, while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost, statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license?]  There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,  how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and  it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,  how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of  these kinds of problems will be open for public or \\\"expert\\\" scrutiny?]    Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,  even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be  an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a  key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political  embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:      (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and        turns the results over to the NY State Police.  But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case. Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.

While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.   There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \\\"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\\\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.   But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \\\"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\\\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \\\"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\\\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \\\"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\\\" (John 16:12).  4. \\\"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\\\" (John 16:25).  5. \\\"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \\\"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\\\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.   Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\",\" You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume no new launcher development.

Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]    Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not \\\"cease to exist.\\\"  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies \\\"separation.\\\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my \\\"girlfriend\\\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.      When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.     This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the \\\"pinpricks\\\" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \\\"The Consciousness of Christ.\\\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He \\\"grew in knowledge.\\\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \\\"led of the Spirit\\\" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.   I was once a member of that club.  THe \\\"free thinker\\\" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \\\"rational doubt\\\" when in fact he was led to it by his \\\"faith\\\".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a \\\"free thinker\\\" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that \\\"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\\\"  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term \\\"a\\\"-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \\\"Look, your fly is undone!\\\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.   Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \\\"Highlander\\\" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.

No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered \\\"immoral\\\" under the previous \\\"definitions\\\" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).\",\"Nikon FM-2n with 50 mm Nikkor and accessories for sale.I bought this camera in Hong Kong two years ago and everything has been looked after very well.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal (Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely (not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.   Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!  Final  I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will not be putting money on this series. :-)    Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is credit to NY.   Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.   I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't think it will go six either...*maybe* five.   If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.    Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.   Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.   It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.    Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.   This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough.  I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.   If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.   Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.   If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, I'd have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.

One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \\\"Spring Festival.\\\"  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in \\\"Die Sprach,\\\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as \\\"hebdomada alba\\\" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as \\\"albae.\\\" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of \\\"alba,\\\" meaning \\\"dawn.\\\" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for \\\"dawn.\\\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

In the NT, it is expected that when believers gather,   - people will prophesy   - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.   Scripture is scripture; there is no \\\"gift of scripture\\\".  And I don't know about you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit.

No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!   Does it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but how to receive it.

The important  thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet \\\"reverse slingshot\\\" that leads to a  weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).\",\"NHL RESULTS FOR GAMES PLAYED 4/14/93.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   STANDINGS       PATRICK              ADAMS              NORRIS              SMYTHE  TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   TM    W  L  T  PT   xPIT  56 21  7 119  xBOS  51 26  7 109  xCHI  46 25 12 104  xVAN  45 29  9  99 yWAS  42 34  7  91  yQUE  47 27 10 104  yDET  46 28  9 101  yCAL  42 30 11  95 yNJ   40 36  7  87  yMON  48 30  6 102  yTOR  44 28 11  99  yLA   39 34 10  88 yNYI  39 37  7  85  yBUF  38 35 10  86   STL  36 36 11  83  yWIN  39 37  7  85  PHL  34 37 11  79   HAR  26 51  6  58   MIN  36 37 10  82   EDM  26 49  8  60  NYR  34 38 11  79   OTT  10 70  4  24   TB   23 53  7  53   SJ   11 70  2  24  x - Clinched Division Title y - Clinched Playoff Berth  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Boston Bruins    (51-26-7)   2   2   0   -   4 Ottawa Senators  (10-70-4)   0   1   1   -   2  1st period: BOS, Roberts 5 - (Juneau) 7:19      BOS, Wiemer 1 - (Juneau, Oates) 17:47  2nd period: BOS, Neely 11 - (Juneau, Murphy) 6:10      BOS, Hughes 5 - (Richer, Kimble) 7:55      OTT, Archibald 9 - (Rumble, Lamb) 11:37     3rd period: OTT, Boschman 9 - (Kudelski) 5:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Bruins   0 of 2    Senators 0 of 4  Shots on Goal- Bruins    13  11  10  -  34   Senators   5   9  12  -  26  Boston Bruins--Moog (36-14-3) (8 shots - 8 saves)  Blue (9:38 second)          (18 shots - 16 saves) Ottawa Senators--Sidorkiewicz (8-46-3) (27 shots - 23 saves)  Berthiaume    (6:36 third) (7 shots - 7 saves)  ATT-10,500  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Washington Capitals   (42-34-7)   0   0   2   -   2 New York Rangers     (34-38-11)   0   0   0   -   0  1st period: NONE  2nd period: NONE  3rd period: WAS, Bondra 36 - (Pivonka, Cavallini) 6:54      WAS, Bondra 37 - (Cote, Pivonka) 10:10  Powerplay Opportunities-Capitals 0 of 2    Rangers  0 of 1  Shots on Goal- Capitals  16  11  12  -  39   Rangers    8   7   8  -  23  Washington Capitals--Tabaracci (7-11-0) (23 shots - 23 saves) New York Rangers--Richter (13-17-3) (39 shots - 37 saves)  ATT-17,897  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  New York Islanders  (39-37-7)   2   1   1   0   -   4 Hartford Whalers    (26-51-6)   2   1   1   1   -   5  1st period: NYI, Ferraro 13 - (Malakhov, King) 1:29      NYI, Hogue 32 - (Thomas, Turgeon) 1:57      HAR, Yake 21 - (Poulin) 4:15      HAR, Yake 22 - (Nylander, Poulin) 16:44  2nd period: HAR, Verbeek 39 - (Cassels, Weinrich) (pp) 2:43      NYI, Thomas 35 - (King, Ferraro) 7:58  3rd period: HAR, Burt 5 - (Sanderson, Cassels) 13:41      NYI, Malakhov 14 - (Hogue) 17:45  Overtime:   HAR, Janssens 12 - (Poulin) 1:08  Powerplay Opportunities-Islanders 0 of 3    Whalers   1 of 3  Shots on Goal- Islanders  16   8   7   1  -  32   Whalers     7  13   7   1  -  28  New York Islanders--Fitzpatrick (16-15-5) (28 shots - 23 saves) Hartford Whalers--Lenaduzzi (1-0-1) (32 shots - 28 saves)  ATT-10,915  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Pittsburgh Penguins  (56-21-7)   2   3   1   0   -   6 New Jersey Devils    (40-36-7)   2   4   0   0   -   6  1st period: PIT, Daniels 5 - (Needham, Tippett) 4:14      NJD, C.Lemieux 29 - (Semak, Driver) 10:19      PIT, K.Stevens 55 - (Tocchet, Murphy) (pp) 12:40      NJD, Zelepukin 22 - (Driver, Niedermayer) 17:26  2nd period: PIT, M.Lemieux 68 - (Stevens, Tocchet) 1:42      NJD, Semak 36 - (C.Lemieux, Zelepukin) 2:27      PIT, McEachern 28 - (Jagr, Barrasso) 4:24      NJD, S.Stevens 12 - (Guerin, Pellerin) 5:45      PIT, M.Lemieux 69 - (sh) 12:40      NJD, Richer 37 - (Nicholls) 15:53      NJD, C.Lemieux 30 - (Semak, Zelepukin) 17:40  3rd period: PIT, Mullen 33 - (Jagr, M.Lemieux) 18:54  Overtime:   NONE  Powerplay Opportunities-Penguins 1 of 5    Devils   0 of 3  Shots on Goal- Penguins   9  11   8   2  -  30   Devils    12  15   9   3  -  39  Pittsburgh Penguins--Barrasso (43-14-5) (39 shots - 33 saves) New Jersey Devils--Billington (21-14-4) (30 shots - 24 saves)  ATT-14,796  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \",\"  ^^^^^^^^  Well, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but I agree that Motorola gear is of better quality.  The question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service   Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is \\\"good enough\\\", and how much is someone willing to pay for it? A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*? Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality gear is \\\"good enough\\\". To each his own...  73... Mike, N4PDY\",\" I've seen them in surplus stores.  All they are are fluorescent bulbs  without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I've also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC socket, probably not what you want.   As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope) exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.  Hope this helps.

They did not have good intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do not justify body counts.    And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons, and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's the whole reason for any of this.    Yeah, I've been related to many of them.  This is flame-bait, right?  I'm not paying your price.  Mind if I sight in my guns on your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In the military, we called this \\\"chicken shit.\\\"  Leadership from the rear. The War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than a continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have gotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes. Mind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms of expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able to influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as a fair and unbiased judiciary.    Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could all file it under \\\"civic improvement\\\" and your life wouldn't have been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to defecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or doesn't protect, everybody equally and how our collective boot may one day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will mature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how serious this is.

They still arm themselves to \\\"defend the #>faith\\\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a #>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives #>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their #>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking. #                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^  By \\\"they,\\\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \\\"accusations\\\" were filed, most of which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts. I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \\\"illegal activities.\\\" Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of \\\"underage\\\" wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it appears, those of David Koresh.  #        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram #were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over #who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like #Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider #Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make #no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The  And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \\\"crime\\\" was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried to explain the \\\"Smith phenomenon\\\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.  #thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed #down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only #entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have #been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The #Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help #here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects. #Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited #for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other #claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)  \\\"The rest\\\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church, while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.  Other rightful \\\"heirs\\\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated (Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified, Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This \\\"Rekhabite\\\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.  Granted, a couple of \\\"do-it-yourselfers\\\" stayed behind, unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The church benefitted from this purification process: they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.  #        Both sects practiced the \\\"1-year food stockpile\\\" doctrine, #and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at #least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a #militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than #face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a #great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite #justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember, #this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people #had nobody to turn to save themselves. # #        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.  BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of the largest denominations in the country) a \\\"sect\\\"???  It didn't \\\"splinter\\\" from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.  #>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very #>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend #>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.

I am not comfortable with this alleged \\\"cosiness\\\" with Mammon: I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about suicide and \\\"atone for sins with blood\\\") is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...  # #        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS #and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts #from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all people are free to worship \\\"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\\\"  #        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true #Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his #own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may #as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected #it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to #Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they #will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like. #These people are the \\\"salt of the Earth\\\" and as such are more #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.  A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's \\\"orders\\\" (the late president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX \\\"Peace Keeper\\\" missile maze in Utah).  #        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have #splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small #and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry. # #        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\",\"}Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human, }we have *all* the advantages.  I agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama, it will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're lucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and steal it!\",\"One thing is certain, though, its still too cold.  After about 40  Hell! This is WARM. I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last  month when the temperature got aboce 40. Try living a couple of years  on the dole, so you cant afford any heating. You put the gear on in October, abd you take it off again in May. Getting out on the bike  seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere  warm.   Its all relative. \",\"  With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to pay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect that the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American shadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market forces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.\",\"There has been some talk recently of Latin rites from the early Church used to bless same-sex unions.If anyone has any idea where copies of these rites exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail.  (I understand that similar ceremonies written in Slavonic exist as well.  Let me know where I can find these.)  It doesn't matter whether the Latin rite is in the original or a translation.  However, I would prefer to have an English version of the Slavon- ic rite, if it exists.  Thanks in advance.

The idea seems to be to reduce inflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work? \",\" If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so. There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits that I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice, either way.  I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.  I don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.  Do *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?   I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion. Are you \\\"unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Quran\\\"?  If that's different, then how is it different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?   Of COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans; that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.   No.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's not something that I want to do, either.   Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is in the getting there!   We don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.   I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.   And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.   Huh?  You're going WAY off the track here.  I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to you so you can ask her, face-to-face.  You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even convince me that it exists!   If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful it is.  Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way: Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to choose one of them over the others.  [ description of Kendigism deleted -- hee hee! ]   That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word I've said.  Have you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few hours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?  The answer is that you think it's fun.  You play the skee-ball over and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out of you.  In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D   So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.   I can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to be significant to me.  Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without invoking them?  Or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own existence?  Why do you believe what you believe? \",\"         ONLY if you weight Americans equal to SAlvadorans.\",\" <apparently you're not a woman - my husband hates the auto door locks <feels safer in a car that locks easily (in addition to watching around <in a secluded spot, etc - have my keys ready to open the door so I'm\",\" Steve,  If the Israelis are stupid enough to \\\"allow\\\" a second \\\"Palestinian\\\" state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

Yashir Koach to this. \",\"Hi,     I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx  260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !    I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".

Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"[...]            ^^^^^ [...] [...]   Given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching equipment, I really hate to jump into this thread.

It -> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for -> maintaining a milita.  -> a free state.  Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun  militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how \\\"well regulated\\\"  modifies \\\"militia\\\" is:  to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, \\\"wet\\\"  modifes \\\"day\\\" in the phrase \\\"a wet day.\\\"  The amendment is similiar to the statement:  A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep  and wear boots, shall not be infringed. So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar, what does the \\\"unorganized militia\\\" have to due with the right to own guns?  -> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn't restrict the right, or -> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other -> than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a -> right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First, -> Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment. -> The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the -> amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right -> to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of -> In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and -> bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.  No not, unconditional, but \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".  Infringed is defined as:  To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,   an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.  To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach. This definition implies the following of some form of existing  agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries  or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word  \\\"unconditional\\\" implies no agreements or all previous agreements  are off, which is the opposite.  The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e., \\\"congress shall make no law,\\\" are much stronger.  They clearly            ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply \\\"unconditional.\\\"  If the writers of the amendment, wanted  unconditional whay didn't they says, \\\"congress shall make no  laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\\"? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped the people from forming a \\\"well regutaled militia.\\\"  The duties of a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" to the government are descussed in  Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II  Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution. \",\"Greetings all.

If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2) a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing?

I don't know what's worse - the waste of money, or the fact that (in SPITE of all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary) this is a feeble attempt by a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently useless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government. This doesn't look very dietetic to me!   As I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to regulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to other countries to communicate their plans, and will still carry them out here and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.  They try to invent a new problem by saying we \\\"need\\\" encryption. I guess it's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a 4-star general or we would all \\\"need\\\" our own copies of MS-DOS too, right?  Und vee haff vays uff findink out iff you are usink DOCTOR DOS!!   Our health care and education systems are in the toilet and they come up with THIS pearl. If this goddamned government doesn't get a clue real quick and start trying to repair the infrastructure of the country rather than inventing someone to blame, Germany and Japan are going to eat the US alive, and we will deserve it. It's not like there's any shortage of REAL problems to solve, guys!   A Clipper chip is really going to help the homeless! A Clipper chip is really going to help educate the children in the ghettos of our cities! Just think of the generation gap that can be developed when they rehire DoD engineer dad to work on Clipper chips that will be used to decrypt slightly rebellious adolescent hacker son's naughty GIF files! I can see the shitcom already.  If that wasn't a forged post or a sick joke, I'm popping that Dead Kennedys tape into the car stereo and tearing ass to Canada. Clinton on White Horse is near. It's the suede/denim secret police! They have come for your uncool niece!

In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650 has the message \\\"fpu: optional\\\".  I know from what we've discussed in this newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80 configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their price list? I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting confused with whether it comes with fpu or not. Why say \\\"optional\\\" if it's built in?

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the  Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they  lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders (what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded.  To NOT RECOGNIZE this, is in effect, close-minded.   I scan it for information, a lot of it is NOISE and pointless flame-age.

They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:  Canadians: 400 Americans: 100 Europeans: 100     Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \\\"Bure\\\" \\\"Konstantinov\\\" and \\\"Borshevshky\\\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \\\"Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket\\\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even better hockey players. It's all hype. This \\\"European mystique\\\" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just don't want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long? Buy a bigger machine. \",\"Looking for people to buy brand new software packages including Microsoft Windows, Harvard Graphics, Pagemaker, Paradox, Lotus, etc. at 20-25% off list price.\",\" I've had PRK.  I would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. Mine said yes to contacts. I think the scars from RK would preclude contacts.   No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.   I find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for others, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the darkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts. \",\"I have a Onkyo integrated amplifier that I am looking to get rid of.  60w/ch  works great  Integra series  not a problem   Asking $100 OBO   If your interested call me at 317-743-2656  or email this address.

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife. I took him to a local \\\"Urgent and General Care\\\" clinic at 5:50 pm.  The  clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the  doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not  see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed  here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several  trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:  - the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,  - the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going    to the emergency room;  - the doctor would not even speak to me;  - she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;  - when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said \\\"I don't know.\\\"  I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, but I was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still  trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a  letter.

Which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent I agree with you.

[...]        No it doesn't. Humans are to some extent similar, because we all belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another story altogether. To a certain extent evolution can even lend credence to moral absolutism (of a flavour).  [...]        You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and kicking. It is, I think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and neither are their moralities.         Similar != identical.

The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL.

This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out.  One more thing about the new, \\\"simpler\\\", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

I sold my (well maintained) '87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition. All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price. I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.     A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Archie   provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the   Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,   point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp   sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows   you to retrieve files located this way.  Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the new features (from the README) follows:    * Major improvements include:     - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new       features (FWF MultiList widget).     - Ability to expand directories in browser.     - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.     - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.     - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable       pseudo-weights.     - Online help browser.     - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.     - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.     - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.  But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation? The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well documented, but what about anything else?  The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and  *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.  So how about it?

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.\\\"                                Ohanus Appressian                             \\\"Men Are Like That\\\"                                    p. 202.   A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Where is your non-existent list of scholars. Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing  years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated  and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy  of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering  2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year  homeland.  The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are   not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.   Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect   your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here   you will find rest...>>[13]  [13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

Jesus is the head of the body, the church    B.  You cannot say \\\"yes\\\" to Jesus, but \\\"no\\\" to the church  Ephesians 2:19-22    A.  The church is the family of God    B.  The church is based on the Word of God only           Cornerstone=Christ           Foundation= Apostles=New Testament                       Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)  1 Corinthians 12:12-13    A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church  As for the question of denominations:    A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians 4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13    B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings)    C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle  Hebrews 10:24-25    A.  Do not miss church    B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. Involved on a relationship level in the church    C.  Must come to ALL services  Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.  Of course, more standards apply:    1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie, disciples).    Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul (natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of Matthew 24).\",\" Wow, does this mean 2 out of 5 homosexuals will be at the March on Washington?

I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in  which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served  on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in  which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker  in federal prison.\",\"I live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities quite frequently, on business.  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000 feet of altitude.  One of them especially is very polluted...  Often I feel faint the first two or three days.  I feel lightheaded, and my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  Also, it is very dry in these cities, so I will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.  Thing is, I still have symptoms.  How can I ensure that my short trips there (no, I don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible? Is there something else that I could do?

The application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science.     Certainly we don't have all the answers.  The question is, what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny, insisting that \\\"tradition\\\" or anecdotal evidence are sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence.

It seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to  explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water. Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.  Thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on one's particular need for Him.\",\"   Other people have already shown this to be a rediculous proposal.  however, I wanted to point out that there are many people who do not think that affirmative action is a either intelligent or productive.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0.  However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.  Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy,  I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.  Here is my suggestion...  1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with  DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that  for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other  utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you   are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)  2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95  for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I  decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!  I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with  large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It  works great.  Not delays.  I think the \\\"A\\\" is better than \\\"B\\\"   arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.  I am looking forward to being able to \\\"LOADHIGH\\\" the DD sw.  That  has been an annoyance.  3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the  effort to upgrade.  Just my $.02 ...  Regards, Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy,  I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.  There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such).  I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper.  -Bruce --    Bruce F.

I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.  I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem.  There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.  Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady  around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files  are compressed image files and some large zip files.    If you have any more specific questions let me know. Dan ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40 MB drives.

Can you reference?  However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:  \\\"Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.   We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.\\\"  (Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam,  p. 118).  I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.

Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\\\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.  ``It wasn't pretty at the end,\\\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but it did.\\\"  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``It's a shame we let down,\\\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\\\"  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and that's all that matters,\\\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\\\"  Some players didn't have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\\\" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\\\"  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.  ``I didn't know it was final,\\\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.\\\"  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\\\" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\\\"  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\\\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know he's happy.\\\"  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds later, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,\\\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\\\"\",\"Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased if the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their argument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.   At that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for our side in the struggle. \",\"Showing a meaningless (relatively) baseball game over the overtime of game that was tied up with less than 3 seconds left on the clock?

Where does ESPN get these BRILLIANT decisions from?\",\"  Well, you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli  patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the \\\"retaliatory\\\" shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli-backed forces. My \\\"team\\\", you see, was \\\"playing fair\\\" while the opposing team was rearranging the faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak.   I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. There are no a priori black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in  retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the Lebanese terrorists.\",\"Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:  1) \\\"I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.\\\"     -Genesis 3.15  2) \\\"He who commits sin is of the devil ...\\\"     -1 John 3.8  3) \\\"Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...\\\"     -Luke 1.28     From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.    First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. \\\"[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him.\\\" John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \\\"the woman\\\", and enmity between Satan and \\\"her seed.\\\"  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve.  \\\"Her seed\\\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.     Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel \\\"full of grace.\\\"  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word \\\"Kecharitomene\\\" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \\\"Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace.\\\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \\\"you who have been\\\" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.     It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in \\\"Ineffibilus Deus.\\\"\",\"   Actually, I beleive \\\"DWI\\\" normally means \\\"Driving While Impaired\\\" rather than \\\"Intoxicated\\\", at least it does in the states I've lived in...

It does not mean that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss were not.  I agree that this is a \\\"heresy\\\".  So what?   The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.   As far as the \\\"unpardonable sin\\\" whatever that is, it is Biblical, and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same. I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't know what you mean by \\\"That He needed to be saved\\\".  Jesus? Jehovah?  Elohim?

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about \\\"High Power Rocketry\\\", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this \\\"blanket waiver\\\". There is also a \\\"High Power Safety Code\\\" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and \\\"safe\\\" flight at a total impulse level.

The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are  intrinsically good (as against Christ's \\\"we are all sinners\\\").  Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken  ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to \\\"awaken\\\" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).

Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.)

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink,  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real? If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the  second floor.

(I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.

If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:  For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net.  We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.  The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been unable to deliver.  Our system produces \\\"near VHS\\\" quality at 30 fields per second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting.  If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing  software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.  Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology and the user interface.

For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality that will satisfy most of your clients.

Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.

Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism. \",\"  This is ok in my opinion as long as the stuff *returns to earth*.   If this turns out to be true, it's time to get seriously active in terrorism. This is unbelievable! Who do those people think they are, selling every bit that promises to make money? I guess we really deserve being wiped out by uv radiation, folks. \\\"Stupidity wins\\\". I guess that's true, and if only by pure numbers.   Another depressed planetary citizen,  hoover   \",\"     I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders. It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology, and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now.      The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs, probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say) a DES keysearch machine.      As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak- nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for (say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for.)      How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers? \\\"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately. Maybe I can help...\\\"        Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant to \\\"practical cryptanalysis.\\\"  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land.\",\" Huh?  If I buy a 128M optical, I might lose my friends?  Why - do they smell bad?  :-)    On a serious note, I have heard the tales about SyQuest failures.  But I am curious about Jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the Bernoullis. Can someone elaborate?  Is there a general consensus that the 128M opticals are the most reliable?  I am mostly concerned about media failures, as opposed to drive mechanism failures.\",\" OY] Henrik (?), OY] Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence.

One of the post-sale questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of an ashtray or a cup holder.  The '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option (which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the ash tray vs cup holder.  It's a step in the right direction.  The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not completely useless.\",\"I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.  The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however trivial, will be immensely appreciated.

This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\"HI,   I am looking for an X app that will display dxf files.

It was a vicious 'boarding' from behind...Trottier was given a major.   But Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill as a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the boards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's skills?     I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.   I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him on this list.  I also think you have a relatively naive view about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of any team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their contribution...I think that most people understand that it's not the Nobel Prize...so settle down.         congenially, as always,   jd   -- James David david@student.business.uwo.ca\",\"I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the \\\"Technicolor Effect\\\" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.  My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_ window of my application, I get my colormap.  Any suggestions?  Thanks,\",\"  I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was \\\"better\\\" - but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure whether I'd believe her.)\",\" As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the  pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it  comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you with short memories. short lives, or both.    To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.\",\"  That's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological burdens, too.   Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism, they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually \\\"believing\\\" in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you originated it.\",\"This just in...  Nolan Ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the Rangers-Orioles game last night.

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much easier do you think it will be to redefine \\\"on your own\\\" to mean write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?  Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type \\\"archie\\\" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject \\\"help\\\" to \\\"archie\\\" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify \\\"archie\\\" as the host name and \\\"archie\\\" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called \\\"The Graphics BBS\\\".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.    As an other example :      echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from   comp.graphics.

Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are willing to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to go back to earning and deserving.  \\\"Are you so foolish?

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar.

Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\"   Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:  The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  (Or is it one key per direction ?) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work. The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, and the session key. This might look like X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.  Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 Bit's.  Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.  As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.  Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ]. How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, but I guess politics will not work that way.  Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!  What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so difficult to do *that* :^)  And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!

In one of Jesus' revelation in this century, \\\"...same thing as in the old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?\\\" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking   they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the \\\"Superconducting Super            Collider\\\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.

Thanks for the help! -Bryan \",\"While there are too many PS clones to count, some of which are quite poor, trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience. Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.\",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / Jason Kratz <U28037@uicvm.uic.edu> /  3:34 pm  Apr 18, 1993 /   Sounds like a VOGON quote to me.....

Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his own rules.\\\"  The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.  Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than 100 German secret police generals.  \\\"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter.

This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been written and is never to be written.\\\"  [Emphasis mine--rje]  The German word Himmler uses that is translated as \\\"extermination\\\" is *Ausrottung*.  Wolfe said a more precise translation would be \\\"extirpation\\\" or \\\"tearing up by the roots.\\\"  In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism, \\\"Judenevakuierung\\\" or \\\"evacuation of the Jews.\\\"  But archives officials said \\\"extermination\\\" is the word he actually spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.

First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun. \",\" These new rule changes are great!

But I still have some reservations.\",\"If you are interested in (any of) the following, please contact me:         EMail           mbeck@vtssi.vt.edu         Phone           (703)552-4381         USMail          Michael Beck                         1200 Progress Street #5500E                         Blacksburg, Virginia 24060 ~~~~~~~~~~FOR SALE as of 12AM 4/16/93~~~~~~~~~~   1       PANASONIC AF X8 CCD OmniMovie Camcorder                 VHS HQ                 High Speed Shutter                 Flying Erase Head                 ca. 3 years old, but only used VERY lightly                 Date/Time stamp                 Counter/Memory                 Rec Review                 Fade                 Back Light                 Auto/Manual Focus                 Built in microphone/Jack for external microphone                 Comes with:                         Sturdy aluminum/hardplastic carrying case                                 (20\\\" long X 13\\\" wide X 6\\\" high)                         Shoulder strap                         Power adaptor/battery charger                         Battery pack                         Remote recording controller                         UHF/VHF ---> cable adaptor                         Audio/Video cables and adaptor                 Aproximate dimensions (measured around outmost features)                         15\\\" long X 4\\\" wide X 8\\\" high (w/ handle)                 ASKING PRICE:  $BEST OFFER  ($700 new price)   1       AMIGA 3000UX    25mhz, unix compatible machine w/100 meg Hard                 Drive, 4 meg RAM, no monitor, keyboard (ESC and ~ keys                  broken)                 ASKING PRICE:   $1500 OBO.   mult.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for          Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and          unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.      B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.      C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.          As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;          Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.      D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.          6:3.      E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives          of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;           Heb. 1:3.      B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph              1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.          2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important works:              a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.              b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                   4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.          3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following ways:              a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11              b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.              c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                   of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.              d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making                    salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.              e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of                   Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13              f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                   Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.              g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                    God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12              h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.              i.   He empowers for living and for service.                     Cf. Acts 1:8  \",\": Oh, yeah?  Well---*I* know of ....

Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"Are breathable liquids possible?  I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was touched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else, I know such liquids ARE possible because...  They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.  Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly shows breathable liquids can be made.\",\" I shipped my K75S from Portland Oregon to Daytona for this years bike week (I rode it back!).

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers   Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not  electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If  you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't  do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,  or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;  mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.   Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National  Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).  To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail  with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections  simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,  we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!   The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the  force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,  however, do not.  Check your with your local building  department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in  Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,  your local electrical utility may also have special requirements  for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that  we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family  residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial  establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different  rules.   Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in  some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary  of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.  Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line  frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number  of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've  noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or  ``CEC''.   Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often  smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?   The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the  National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.  It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.  You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly  at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the  full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged  edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.  And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized  commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the  recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for  the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --  US$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?   The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up  of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance  companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.  The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two  or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,  this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.  Since each province publishes its own slightly modified  standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA  standard itself.  In this FAQ, \\\"CEC\\\" really means the  appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is  derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th  edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th  edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an  attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.   The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical  inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In  Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't  overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I  hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the  equivalent NEC publications.   Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout  the province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?   In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.  In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical  inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's  homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do  wiring in \\\"commercial\\\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)  are usually considered \\\"semi-commercial\\\" or \\\"commercial\\\".  However,  many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial  wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can  find one willing to supervise.   If you do your own wiring, an important point:   Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better  job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,  and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make  a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills  and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.  In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that  are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,  and will impress the inspector.   The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to  earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your  time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.  Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely  picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.   Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.   Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip  wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector  won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it  takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of  12ga wire through your hand that way.   Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C  or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types  become very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?   First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few  screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're   lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved  devices) you need Robertson (\\\"square recess\\\") screwdrivers  (#1 and #2) instead of phillips.   For drilling a few holes, a 3/4\\\" or 1\\\" spade bit and 1/4\\\" or  3/8\\\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or  are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\\\" drill  (right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and  3/4\\\" or 1\\\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull  you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even  in 90 year old hardwood timbers.   Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you  install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws  work well).    For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or  ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \\\"combo stripper,  crimper and bottle opener\\\" types.  You should expect to pay  $15 to $20 for a good \\\"plier-type\\\" pair.  It will have sized  stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should  be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the  blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There  are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't  necessary, and pros usually don't use them.   A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends  in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.   You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.   You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling  inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire  loops with a \\\"loop former hole\\\" on your wire stripper - more  accurate.   If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for  removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the  end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,  and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a  \\\"zipper\\\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip  the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to  slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley  utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)  can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility  that you'll gouge the conductors.   For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well  worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).  Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire  or the insulation.   Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired  outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more  expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple  voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated  wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost  about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.   You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are  dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)  and work well.  If you get more serious, a \\\"audible alarm\\\" type is  good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known  to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)   For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.  Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or  a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.   Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent  wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for  wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap   around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination  screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to  prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet  that has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?   The UL stands for \\\"Underwriters Laboratory\\\".  It used to be  an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent  and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment  for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means  that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements  for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily  mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just  that it probably won't kill you.   The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are  permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,  insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will  limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to  the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in  many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component  used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.  Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring  must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or  occupancy permits issued.   Subject: What is CSA approval?   Every electrical device or component must be certified by the  Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in  Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done  with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to  the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is  required by law.   Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved  equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the  claim.   In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC  (UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to  be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance  companies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?   USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers       Residential Wiring      by Jeff Markell,      Craftsman Books,      Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.       Practical Electrical Wiring      Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National      Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70      Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan      McGraw-Hill Book Co.       Wiring Simplified      H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan      Park Publishing Co.    Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC  revision.  Which is currently 1990.   Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called  \\\"Electrical Code Simplified\\\".  There appears to be a version  published specific to each province, and is very tied into the  appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,  and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get  this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer  questions on the net ;-).   It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is  available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?   Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and  inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more  mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not  liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections  provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors  or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose  their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.   Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your  home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a  permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about  this.   If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at  fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage  claims.   In general, the process goes like this:   - you apply to your local inspections office or building     department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or     detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is     a good time to ask questions on any things you're not     sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose     special conditions on you, require loading     calculations and ask other questions.  At this point     they will tell you which inspections you will need.   - If you're installing a main panel, you will need to     have the panel and service connections inspected     before your power utility will provide a connection.     This is sometimes done by the local power authority     rather than the usual inspectors.   - After installing the boxes and wiring, but before     the insulation/walls go up, you will need a     \\\"rough-in\\\" inspection.   - After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,     you will need a \\\"final inspection\\\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.  Do I have to upgrade?   In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,  though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some  cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the  latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you  may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all  of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240   One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the  different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of  a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V  or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same  thing...  In North America the utility companies are required  to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.  This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there  are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not  unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped  to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially  at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number  of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,  different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.  This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \\\"110V\\\" and  \\\"220V\\\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will  be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.   One thing that might make this a little more understandable  is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V  instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device  is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that  low.   208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between  phases of a 3-phase \\\"Y\\\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any  hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \\\"Y\\\"  circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.   In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended  to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?   There are logically four wires involved with supplying the  main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility  pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.    The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded   into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes   to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where  the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic  action conductivity \\\"breaks\\\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).  This is the \\\"grounding conductor\\\".  It is there to make sure that  the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire  normally carries no current.   One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or  yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.  It is connected to the \\\"centre tap\\\" (CEC; \\\"center tap\\\" in the  NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It  is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often  inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected  anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.   Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in  a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.  These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral  at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional  grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house  wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.   If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually  brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are  not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one  neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations   (certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do  have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your  inspector.   The other two wires will usually be black, and are the \\\"hot\\\"  wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as  well.   The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each  other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,  the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the  white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.   Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.  This is either because the neutral and ground are connected  together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one  wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some  rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only  service).  Subject: What is a circuit?   Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.  These connections are then used to supply power to selected  portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:   1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.   2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.   3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,      and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.   (1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and  lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying  power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they  often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several  circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is  usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or  air conditioners.   [Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar  to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there  are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral  and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing  the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead  of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.  When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles  are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but  the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,  and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to  local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is  permissible.]   (1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,  white for neutral, and bare for grounding.   (2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a  bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.   You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground  wire.  Since the white is \\\"hot\\\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC  requires that the white wire be \\\"permanently marked\\\" at the ends  to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail  polish or sometimes electrical tape.   Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the  panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.   There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)  or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places  require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \\\"frame ground\\\",  the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an  alternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \\\"grounding\\\" versus \\\"grounded\\\" versus \\\"neutral\\\".   According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the  \\\"grounding\\\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green  or bare wire.  The word \\\"neutral\\\" is reserved for the white when  you have a circuit with more than one \\\"hot\\\" wire.  Since the white  wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the  panel, the proper term is \\\"grounded conductor\\\".  However, the  potential confusion between \\\"grounded conductor\\\" and \\\"grounding  conductor\\\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should  never use the bare wire as a \\\"grounded conductor\\\" or white wire  as the \\\"grounding conductor\\\", even though they are connected  together in the panel.   [But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground  separately from the main panel.  Usually.]   In the trade, and in common usage, the word \\\"neutral\\\" is used  for \\\"grounded conductor\\\".  This FAQ uses \\\"neutral\\\" simply to  avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \\\"neutral\\\"  too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light  switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?   Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power  to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For  example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should  \\\"trip\\\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As  such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the  wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the  equipment itself won't cause a fire.   Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt  (safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby  interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively  fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have  large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use  a \\\"time-delay\\\" fuse (one brand is \\\"fusetron\\\") which will avoid  tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a  spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be  replaced.   Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They  usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched  into position against another contact.  When the current flow  through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip  heats up and bends.  By bending it \\\"trips\\\" the latch, and the  spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave  similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to  trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high  overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite  number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown  when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which  damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in  place of switches unless they are specially listed for the  purpose.   Neither fuses nor breakers \\\"limit\\\" the current per se.  A dead  short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even  thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which  can often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?   Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher  risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually  due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts  corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse  being installed, or the proverbial \\\"replace the fuse with a  penny\\\" trick.   Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better  connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.   Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When  a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting  path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,  melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical  distribution transformer and having your house burn down.  Breakers don't do this.   Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit  fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new  fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special  inserts to \\\"key\\\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)   Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse  protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse  is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the  labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently  installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you  if you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?   For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,  you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,  though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid  voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than  14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.   Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for  more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or  ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate  heat easily:    Gauge  Amps   14  15   12  20   10  30   8  40   6  65    We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent  on the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?   There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.  The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When  the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is  more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need  higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in  conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long  runs.   Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.  There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller  wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most  lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits  one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger  wire.  Subject: What does \\\"14-2\\\" mean?   This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors  in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second  the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but  remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \\\"14-2\\\" means  14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.   -2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes  the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In  the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.   -3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.  Usually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \\\"wirenut\\\"/\\\"marrette\\\"/\\\"marr connector\\\"?  How are they  used?   A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used  to connect wires together.  \\\"Marrette\\\" or \\\"Marr connector\\\"  are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.   In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them  together, then twist the wirenut on.   Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the  wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically  secure.   There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check  that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the  quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.   Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or  your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\\\"linesman\\\") pliers,  and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes  it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it  goes in the wirenut properly.   Some people wrap the \\\"open\\\" end of the wirenut with electrical  tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may  tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because  a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead  of taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?   A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures  the current current flowing through the hot wire and the  neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the  presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other  path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of  an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any  of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking  the circuit.   GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,  for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral  leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI  wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot  lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the  GFCI happy.   The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.  One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed  *must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be  protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices  downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be  covered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?   The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase  outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,  unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or  just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water  or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,  those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',  typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and  laundry appliances.   The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there  is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or  basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you  have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to  outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.   Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may  want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI  breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI  outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in  Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your  finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?  Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does  water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?   GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a  safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run  unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,  and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs  are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that  the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary  current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most  GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no  apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring  before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?   For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the  first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with  a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI  breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE  breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one  major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch  circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),  such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a  multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;  the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on  what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such  a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.   One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use  an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use  large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.   Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one  specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't  really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first  outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet  in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But  protecting the whole circuit is preferred.   When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little  \\\"ground fault protected\\\" stickers that come with it and mark  the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which  outlets are \\\"downstream\\\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the  test button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?   Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,  and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without  a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against  insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of  the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an  insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the  ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly  trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not  grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if  you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of  course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very  tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace  ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).   There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In  particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with  exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating  electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will  happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;  the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were  grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to  ground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization   Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the  other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)  on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.  This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the  the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to  have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).   Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.   This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right  way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the  narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the  hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.  If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which  prong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?   The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance  circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex  receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more  than 24\\\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider  than 12\\\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.  The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except  in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits  are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,  lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be  protected by a GFCI (NEC only).   Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab  is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to  the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.  The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When  \\\"carrying through\\\" to another outlet, the neutral must be  pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral  connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect  from downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?   There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to  the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in  the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?   Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.  Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.  This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside  stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject  to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are  wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several  different categories of NM cable.   BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \\\"AC\\\" has a  flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is  fairly resistant to damage.   TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic  sheath.    Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable  is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer  surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\\\" (CEC & NEC)  from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected  from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of  metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.   [Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored  cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,  but this is technically illegal.]   Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the  Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague  references to \\\"exposed to mechanical damage\\\" in both the NEC  and CEC):       - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage        where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls        in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.        Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.      - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces        or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian        practise is usually to install a junction or outlet        box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable        or NM cable in flexible conduit to \\\"jump\\\" to the appliance.        Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.      - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating        ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by        means of a 25mm/1\\\" air space, or suitable insulation        material (a wad of fiberglass).      - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box        or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.        Holes in joists or studs are considered \\\"supports\\\".        Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to        each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,        it is permitted where \\\"proper\\\" support is impractical]      - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.        [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring        to the \\\"workmanship\\\" clause, but this seems more honoured        in the breach...]      - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or        similar finish.      - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.      - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists        or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more        than 1m (39\\\").   Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small  plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to  prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through  the insulation.   BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by  solid wall coverings.   In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of  a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a  UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of  fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the  wire.   Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.   In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will  need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like  very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of  conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground  wiring section.]    Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be   exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that   purpose.   Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through  furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed  by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this  is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses  from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.  Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.     Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,   except that Canadian wire designations usually include the   temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \\\"AC90\\\" versus \\\"AC\\\".  In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.   NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes  most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.  There are very different requirements for mobile homes.  Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything  that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable  only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box  itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic  boxes don't use metal cable clamps.   The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable  armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still  provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also  requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.   The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for  non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground  connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other  hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For  exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?   A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.   Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible  later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction  boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may  get nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?   In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few  caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage  rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half  a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire  back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle  constraints as well.  For example, older house  wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess  heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the  insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.  Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high  temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your  ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case  replacing any devices is a real adventure.)   Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some  fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and  its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy  chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box  specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling  joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available  that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and  mounted between the joists.   There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as  \\\"pot\\\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated  ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.  The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated  ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \\\"coffin\\\" (usually  8'x16\\\"x12\\\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\\\" high, and covering  with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*  long)   NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\\\"  clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.  The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,  which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.  Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't  actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector  requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get  accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown  in later.]   There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and  fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are  usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat  more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should  ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.  Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location  for the sensor can vary.   There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved  for use in insulation.  The \\\"coffin\\\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?   This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is  loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up  being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with  respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can  destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in  some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions  require the stove frame connected to neutral).   If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately  and have them come and check out the problem.   Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with  lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A  loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness  far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?   Three phase power has three \\\"hot\\\" wires, 120 degrees out of  phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors  because it is more \\\"efficient\\\", provides a bit more starting torque,  and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.   You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows  110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between  any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal  220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the  two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.   Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually  ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you  want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to  buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is  possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have  a \\\"capacitor start\\\" unit, or use a larger motor as a  (auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if  the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to  replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an  article on how to do this if you must.   Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using  such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?   Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there  is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply  wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times  less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also  means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor  will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the  smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.   This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more  than 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?   It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746  watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,  it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200  watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,  so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational  efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.   Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router  manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far  in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \\\"stall  horsepower\\\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when  the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.  What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that  condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker  will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far  more current than it can continuously.   When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This  should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,  check the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?   Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead  of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety  ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither  the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.   There are several different approaches to solving this:      1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the         conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect         the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle         box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.      2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and         it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can         run a conductor to it from the third prong.      3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.      4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug         should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI         protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI         will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong         outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,         the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it         wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault         could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected         to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't         indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath         on BX cable.   The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three  prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.  Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?  Should the test button work?   We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,  that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's  a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE  side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current  through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.  This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require  a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press  the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:  if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially  dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.   The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground  wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The  causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the  formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never  tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,  UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device  behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded  outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are  labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician  was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require  it, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?   As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all  devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies  that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the  circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for  the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or  shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have  big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp  breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles  which means you'd have to \\\"replug\\\" all your equipment.  Lights  should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared  with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two  separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a  situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand  RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.   Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the  beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.  It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each  point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same  time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and  plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have  objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit  wrong.   Note that some jurisdictions have a \\\"no horizontal wiring\\\"  rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used  for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be  run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.   Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V  circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.  Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you  can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled  extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of  the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much  heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)   If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,  you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop  wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to  equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.  If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''  particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.  For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to  handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy  ``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.   Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished  basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And  even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop  outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might  have a different idea.   Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop  wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring   You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use  special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic  tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots  thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion  of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is  generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically  listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,  fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion  in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And  of course, don't forget the GFCIs.   The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about  your specific situation.   A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \\\"buried power  line\\\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring   During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became  quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,  aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,  and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.  We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new  wiring.   But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum  wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.  Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper  installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential  problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.   The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as  \\\"cold creep\\\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When  it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes  through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each  time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes  when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance  of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/  oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,  melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even  cause a fire.   Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move  into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of  safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing  a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you  hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring  for the following things:       1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to         aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will         be stamped with \\\"Al/Cu\\\" or \\\"CO/ALR\\\".  The latter supersedes         the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat         more expensive than the ordinary ones.       2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around         the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be         tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the         problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug         up each connection.          Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the         main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.       3) \\\"push-in\\\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.         Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with         the proper screw connections immediately.       4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,         melted insulation, or \\\"baked\\\" fixtures.  Any such damage should         be repaired.            5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be         handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the         wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting         aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be         connected together using special crimp devices, with an         anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter         are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless         you can rent the tool.       6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring         by means of a short copper \\\"pigtail\\\".  See (5) above.            7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped         (not nicked) wire etc.       If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring  shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider  the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,  we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,  you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having  this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.  You can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?   Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire  an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.  Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an  inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor  ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any  minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many  places, we suggest you look elsewhere.   Here's some hints on what to look for:   Obvious non-code wiring can include:    - Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls   - Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without     proper marking.   - Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of     a GFCI)   - Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)   - Switched neutrals   - Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines   Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one  time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:    - Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps      not properly terminated wiring)   - A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are     separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when     it's *really* convenient ;-)   - Switches and outlets in bizarre locations   - Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps   - Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them   - Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or     ceiling   - Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring    In the years since Edison \\\"invented\\\" electricity, several different  wiring \\\"styles\\\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you  may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old   methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.   The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called  \\\"knob and tube\\\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with  a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural  members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).  Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections  were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping  with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,  the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs  down the centre of each room, with \\\"taps\\\" off to each fixture.  The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some  cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same  colour as the hot wires.   You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.   Comments on K&T:    - the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about     electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.   - The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up     very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in     quite good condition.   - No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.   - boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with     GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,     so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.   - Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between     separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to     overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on     any circuit.   - Building code does not permit insulation in walls     that contain K&T.   - Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be     tricky.  Consult your inspector.   - Modern wiring practise requires considerably more     outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.    Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't  necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should  watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and  be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly  reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on  new circuits using modern techniques.    After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type  you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks  much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was  used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.  It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback  is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole  systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at  a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.   This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if  the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as  much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.  A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several  hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink  tubing.   After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.  It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.  This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard  and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be  replaced - it should be considered as safe as the \\\"modern\\\" stuff -  thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?   Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their  prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or  DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety  including the \\\"odd\\\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that  know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable  sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.\",\" Oh, darn.

(1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:                   Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again\\\" (Matthew 20:18-19).            Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).            How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are these:            First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were taught:  and this saying is com-                monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew 28:11-15).            This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-      18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He      walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that      night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).            A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren      on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the      apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-      8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:      it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\",\"    Why is this surprising?

Again, this is reposted with permission.  Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.  Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper). Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES, which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I don't think you can impugn his integrity.  Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.

The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES.   In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his   or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key   plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be   K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method (e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol.    encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK,   and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part   message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK   producing        E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}  My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the \\\"family key\\\") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.

Compute the 64-bit block           R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]   (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that they're called seeds suggests they might.)

Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be   decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that   they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they   must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased.   Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions. Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions I've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia, LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.   When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law   enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information   flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that   they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a   court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links   over which a message will flow.]   My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box, which will have been keyed with K.   for \\\"the wiretap authorizations.\\\" When Levy asked for  the details so he could review the cases as required by  law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned  over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time.

The fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why I am an atheist.   Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims.       It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil, is another evil.       The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known, the course of events is fixed.   Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.       And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.

I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of \\\"cosmic essence.\\\" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery.

The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.

And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?  That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\\\"  A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise.  Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for \\\"Editor and Publisher\\\", a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field.  He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's fifth book on usage, \\\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\\\" has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.  That sounds like an expert to me.  After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent the following letter:  \\\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.  \\\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further, since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under oath to support, if necessary.\\\"  My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment, then concluded:  \\\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment. While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\\\"  After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):  [Copperud:] \\\"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb 'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia.  \\\"In reply to your numbered questions:  [Schulman:] \\\"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed' null and void?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,' 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military.\\\"  [Schulman:] \\\"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \\\"Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'  [Schulman:] \\\"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence,  \\\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be infringed.'  \\\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,  \\\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?; and  \\\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\\\"  [Copperud:] \\\"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure.  \\\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation.\\\"  Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his cover letter: \\\"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach any conclusion.\\\"  So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.  As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.  And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely. American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms, guaranteed by the Constitution.  And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.  it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?  Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

About the Author  J. Neil Schulman is the award-winning author of novels endorsed by Anthony Burgess and Nobel-economist Milton Friedman, and writer of the CBS \\\"Twilight Zone\\\" episode in which a time-traveling historian prevents the JFK assassination.  He's also the founder and president of SoftServ Publishing, the first publishing company to distribute \\\"paperless books\\\" via personal computers and modems.  Most recently, Schulman has founded the Committee to Enforce the Second Amendment (CESA), through which he intends to see the individual's right to keep and bear arms recognized as a constitutional protection equal to those afforded in the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth amendments.  ------------- End included article --------  Can you still honestly say the Second is a 'State-Run militia only right'? \",\" Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible trio who allegly represent me.  Instead, I wrote to Bentsen.  My letter was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew there were kids).  Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to  me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However, I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.   This section is not in the letter that I received.  The parts about ATF logo and steenking badges or their loss of the element of surprise were not included, either.   The same guy with the bad handwriting apparently signed my letter, \\\"for Richard L. Garner; Chief, Special Operations Division\\\".\",\"    Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness, being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.   I fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying, but since I won't be around to worry about it, I don't fear eternal death.   This is something I've always found confusing.  If all your nerve endings die with your physical body, why would flame hurt you?  How can one \\\"wail and gnash teeth\\\" with no lungs and no teeth? \",\"     If the nose culture shows Staph, then Ceftin or even Ceclor      are better. Suprax does not kill Staph. Treating bacterial      infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the      infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant      strains. Some 60% of Hemophilus Influenza strains are now      resistant. What works for me and my organisms may not work      for you and yours. Keep experimenting.         Ken Colby  \",\"NUT CASE PANICS!!!!JUMPS THE GUN ON THE NET BEFORE GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT!!!! \",\"I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal  assault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration  nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever  in regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating  `acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we  should rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious  proposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.  I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S. government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any serious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this  proposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is  wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.   It seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be  tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason. These actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here. But if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should find merit with it nevertheless.)  Cryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong  cryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen,  housewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable  equilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian  arrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent  impracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.   For too long our government has demonstrated itself to be  increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality  and protecting Americans.   It is not possible for the Federal Government to ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive policies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.  The administration has to be committed to leaving private  industries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no  legitimate role in regulating the content of communications. Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be  disarmed of it.    No such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent to a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of  extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will trade threats for threats, and violation for violation.   If the administration did say this, it would find itself  impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential, established, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy  guarantees. The administration would have no legal standing  whatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast  segments of the population.   The U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically  committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an  increasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.   Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses. We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please,  and we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit  pattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop  us, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.  [privacy vs. law enforcement]  This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally  incompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise.  Americans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology,  to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly  been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and  *unrepresentative* government.  --\",\"What in blazes is going on with Wayne Matson and gang down in Alabama?  I also heard an unconfirmed rumor that Aerospace Ambassadors have disappeared.  Can anyone else confirm??\",\"   As usual, when Salah is not totally racist, she manages to get virtually all the facts wrong.  Assad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria, but not to go to Israel.  Unfortunately, not all of them have escaped yet, but not because they don't want to leave;  rather, Assad went back on his word and stopped issuing travel permits.  He claimed bureaucratic snags, but everyone knows it was a tactic to pressure Israel.\",\" ------------ Part 5 of 14 ------------ M)B9R&KJZ)EVZ=+ITNKH>?7U=PGU]+\\\"Q=?72_=\\\"PU'GT>+,<LORPU86$1EX,8

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).  I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \\\"jaggies.\\\"  I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the \\\"context\\\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.  Thanks in advance for any help. \",\"I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population.  It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as well post something new myself.  Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core, than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it expresses its own selfishness.

We are God's children and we must have a true and authentic relationship with our Father with obedience, faith, hope and  love and works (the last as the most important).  Beware of our 'materialistic', 'worldly' and 'selfish' motives.   Atheists have this ground against us and I believe they are right about *some* who call themselves 'christians'.\",\"The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING \\\"medical\\\" establishment.      Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article:                             NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                  A 3RD OPINION                           ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )             DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources            that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of            this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his            First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the            subjects of his choice.              ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.             MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food            Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this:  (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:   - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple  as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's  nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between  screens?   - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate  screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?  What are they; who sells them...   - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a  window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?   - Is there any way for the application to transparently see  multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware  only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?   - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a  system capable of using either multiple screens or a single  screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate  multiple screens instead)?    I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely  on providing config files which will specify for each  configuration the screen placement of each window in the  application.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17\\\" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.  Do not buy a 486SX sytem.  My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.\",\":  : Can you please point to something, anything, that proves to me that : the universe cannot possibly be explained without accepting as a fact : the existence of a god in precisely the way your holy book describes? :  : Can you please convince me that your religion is more than a very : cleverly-constructed fable, and that it does indeed have some bearing : on my own personal day-to-day life?

So I went into win.ini (is there another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added   equation=equation,equation,<path\\\\filename>,picture.  didn't work. quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine. start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I get it to work.

It was a waste of the Net's time.  I hope, though, that most American citizens have the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to understand the relationship between the Justice Department as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which are of the Judicial Branch.   Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.   \",\"  I didnot know that \\\"Master of wisdom\\\" can be \\\"name clling\\\" too, unless you consider yourself deserve-less !   That was only to confuse you! (ha ha ha hey )          ^^^^^^^ are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here.   First, my above statement doesnot say that \\\"the existence of israeli citizens in the WB revoke their right of life\\\" but it says \\\"the israeli occupation of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically revokes the right of for its military men\\\". Clearly, occupation is an undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing Palestinean human rights.     Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights. (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).   Exactly, you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment  is full with  men like Joseph Weitz.

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a Zionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts, well i feel sorry for you, because the same Rabbi Shoham had said \\\"Yes, Zionism is racism\\\". If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism. If you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me in condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.

Seems he was being too successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.\",\"OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:  02106@chopin.udel.edu or 02106@ravel.udel.edu or 02106@bach.udel.edu or 02106@brahms.udel.edu  NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!  Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).  For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!  All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  : Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? : You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they : exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone : know how they perform?  You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism as standard IDE.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price.  No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.
