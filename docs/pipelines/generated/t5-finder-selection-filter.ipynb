I reinstalled my system software twice in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on the screen - it freezes.  I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at startup.  I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't afford to be without my Duo at this time.  Anyone out there with these same problems? \",\"The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from them doing more than this.  This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on the surface.  Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market. It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for most phone companies.  You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.  And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now, after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police.  Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap, only the Mob will buy them.  And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones, because \\\"the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police.\\\"  Interesting.\",\" I would guess not.

If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isn't.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.    One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for  pointing out the parallel. \",\"I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific  brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machines consist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them. They strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing LEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available. I've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for relaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc... I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful, The few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a friend who has tried them claims that \\\"every home should have one\\\"). So  do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if any has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer? Or are they just another bit of quackery?

He is speaking at Hillel on the U.C. Berkeley campus.\",\" The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.   That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire (BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.  My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:  (1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add     machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going     for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which     means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.     As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).  (2) On the Mac side, you will need:     - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).     - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).     - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be       getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the       Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is       self-terminated or not.     - configure MacTCP to use \\\"Ethernet\\\".  (3) On the DECstation side, you will need:     - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.     - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.       Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the       DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable       (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).     - get a 25ohm terminator.

So here it comes:  CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its \\\"current directory\\\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems  to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \\\"dithering\\\", again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again.  (It does this last \\\"recopy\\\" operation for its \\\"fit to screen\\\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)   The result of this process is the following:         1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all         you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of         data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never         realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.       2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for         the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the         dithering and writes to the screen card.         However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data         from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)         one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which         there was room on the disk.  This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space.   CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing? \",\"or there   Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.  The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was because of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines).  When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \\\"I want to play a mono sound\\\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound.  Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from the IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.  Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware, and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works. On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra 700/900/950 at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only. Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification, but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.  If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their games will only come out the left on some games.  The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what machine you have.  Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: and also Hellcats, Super Tetris Oxyd (and many more, these are just what I've tested)  Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.   Other games you list: and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization (and more, these are again only from personal experience)  Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.  The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to do, but I'm going say it anyway. Stop cheating on sound! Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period is about to end. The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will work even better soon, so use it.  In conclusion: To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all hardware.   Have fun.  Disclaimer number 1: I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. So don't write me with sound questions.  Disclaimer number 2: If it says up above that I wrote anything like \\\"the grace period is about to end\\\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.  Disclaimer number 3: I don't speak for Apple, just me.\",\"Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E.

A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.

Several people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated  exactly what I am looking for.  I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.

If so, the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.  Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, \\\"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?\\\"  If there are things  which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.\",\" Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on.  I might as well say \\\"We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.\\\"   Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.  As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to use.   The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him down \\\"until he gets warmed up\\\".   Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do with Javy Lopez?   See above.     But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year either.   And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.   Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're being charitable.   Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.    Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.   Just like Keith Mitchell did?   That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience, or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more flattering to the organization.

We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\"  There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word \\\"medicine\\\" instead of drug.  With regard to the condition of the human soul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  It also strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created  us.   Christ's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to reality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength of spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way.

You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\" No, they fold on the dotted line.

From the March 1993 \\\"Aero Vision\\\" (The newsletter for the Employees of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).      SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY      \\\"On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.   launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.   The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and   SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed   Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force   Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for   potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were   successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria   and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the   cafeteria.      Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the   McDonnell Douglas DC-X.

My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point. What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.  After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or excommunicated.

My comments are based primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \\\"The Trinitarian Controversy\\\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the \\\"Apologists\\\".  Their theology has often been described as \\\"Logos theology\\\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This \\\"immanent Word\\\" became \\\"expressed\\\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the \\\"economy\\\").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should probably be called \\\"economic trinitarianism\\\", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism   Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end.  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism   Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting \\\"three in oneness\\\" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [I've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  \\\"Economic\\\" Trinitarianism   Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various \\\"neo-economic\\\" Trinitarians Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as \\\"distinction\\\" and \\\"distribution\\\" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \\\"eternally generated\\\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that \\\"there was once when he was not\\\" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate \\\"hypostases\\\", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (\\\"of the same substance\\\").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]   Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \\\"Threeness in oneness\\\" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence.  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox Trinitarianism   Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \\\"undivided in divided persons.\\\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of \\\"three in oneness.\\\" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

The word harass means to  irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.  I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.  The number of people who participate in \\\"victimless\\\" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"Hi ... can anyone tell me where I can get a copy of updated Canon BJ-200 printer driver for Windows 3.1, if any ?

Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.   Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however.

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey's expense.

It -> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for -> maintaining a milita.  -> a free state.  Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun  militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how \\\"well regulated\\\"  modifies \\\"militia\\\" is:  to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, \\\"wet\\\"  modifes \\\"day\\\" in the phrase \\\"a wet day.\\\"  The amendment is similiar to the statement:  A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep  and wear boots, shall not be infringed. So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?

All it does is make a positive statement regarding a -> right of the people.

No not, unconditional, but \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".  Infringed is defined as:  To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,   an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.  To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach. This definition implies the following of some form of existing  agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries  or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word  \\\"unconditional\\\" implies no agreements or all previous agreements  are off, which is the opposite.  The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e., \\\"congress shall make no law,\\\" are much stronger.  They clearly            ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply \\\"unconditional.\\\"  If the writers of the amendment, wanted  unconditional whay didn't they says, \\\"congress shall make no  laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\\"? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped the people from forming a \\\"well regutaled militia.\\\"  The duties of a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" to the government are descussed in  Federalist No. 29.

Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it BM] is a part of it.    Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged  training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.   henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000  henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the  henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending  henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION.   BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM]  within their borders?     Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into          the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.  henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the  henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER  henrik] OCCUR again.  BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?     It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped    into Armenia if SHE could.

That's hard to do when Armenians  BM] are attacking Azeri towns.   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey         wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!   I will believe it when I see it.   Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing         to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean  BURNING people ALIVE !  BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.     Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are          NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN.   BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent  BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe  BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better  BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the  conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in  KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.  BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of  BM] their blood and future.    Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension         to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH         are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.  BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  BM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\"[deleted for a very good reason which I'm sure you can guess]  0.

(Of course these could all be wrong.....)   from                        THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                Dorothy Denning                            Revised, April 21, 1993  . . .  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  . . .  ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  ------------------  suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field     E[E[K; U] + N; F] not knowing N would might make this much harder.  Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not), If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the other party.  If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too.  Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system.  Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \\\"panel of experts\\\" is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

But, this does not imply that a painless death is cruel, which is what you are supposed to be trying to show.\",\"  Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by \\\"question authority\\\". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say \\\"I question to word of this authority\\\" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be \\\"authenticate authority.\\\" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.   \",\"   I'm not sure who the \\\"original respondent\\\" was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not synonymous.  So in sum and to beat a dead horse:  (1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.  (2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more \\\"color sensitive\\\" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors.  (3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are \\\"processed centrally\\\".

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian, she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite.  Levon K.

Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.   Source: Stanford J.

Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First  World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse  to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other  invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian  success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of  Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common  soldiers began deserting in droves.\\\"  \\\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of  World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy  increased drastically.

The two-day program, cosponsored by the library and Baltimore Hebrew University, with additional support from the Project Judaica Foundation, will be held in the library's Mumford Room, sixth floor, Madison Building.    Seating is limited, and admission to any session of the symposium must be requested in writing (see Note A).    The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a major exhibition, \\\"Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship,\\\" that opens at the Library of Congress on April 29.  On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special collections will augment these materials.  The exhibition, on view in the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles east of Jerusalem.  The symposium will explore the origin and meaning of the scrolls and current scholarship.  Scholars from diverse academic backgrounds and religious affiliations, will offer their disparate views, ensuring a lively discussion.    The symposium schedule includes opening remarks on April 21, at 2 p.m., by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, and by Dr. Norma Furst, president, Baltimore Hebrew University.  Co-chairing the symposium are Joseph Baumgarten, professor of Rabbinic Literature and Institutions, Baltimore Hebrew University and Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, Library of Congress.    Geza Vermes, professor emeritus of Jewish studies, Oxford University, will give the keynote address on the current state of scroll research, focusing on where we stand today. On the second day, the closing address will be given by Shmaryahu Talmon, who will propose a research agenda, picking up the theme of how the Qumran studies might proceed.    On Wednesday, April 21, other speakers will include:     -- Eugene Ulrich, professor of Hebrew Scriptures, University of Notre Dame and chief editor, Biblical Scrolls from Qumran, on \\\"The Bible at Qumran;\\\"    -- Michael Stone, National Endowment for the Humanities distinguished visiting professor of religious studies, University of Richmond, on \\\"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha.\\\"    -- From 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. a special preview of the exhibition will be given to symposium participants and guests.     On Thursday, April 22, beginning at 9 a.m., speakers will include:     -- Magen Broshi, curator, shrine of the Book, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on \\\"Qumran: The Archaeological Evidence;\\\"    -- P. Kyle McCarter, Albright professor of Biblical and ancient near Eastern studies, The Johns Hopkins University, on \\\"The Copper Scroll;\\\"    -- Lawrence H. Schiffman, professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies, New York University, on \\\"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the History of Judaism;\\\" and    -- James VanderKam, professor of theology, University of Notre Dame, on \\\"Messianism in the Scrolls and in Early Christianity.\\\"     The Thursday afternoon sessions, at 1:30 p.m., include:     -- Devorah Dimant, associate professor of Bible and Ancient Jewish Thought, University of Haifa, on \\\"Qumran Manuscripts: Library of a Jewish Community;\\\"    -- Norman Golb, Rosenberger professor of Jewish history and civilization, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, on \\\"The Current Status of the Jerusalem Origin of the Scrolls;\\\"    -- Shmaryahu Talmon, J.L.

There will be ample time for question and answer periods at the end of each session.     Also on Wednesday, April 21, at 11 a.m.:    The Library of Congress and The Israel Antiquities Authority will hold a lecture by Esther Boyd-Alkalay, consulting conservator, Israel Antiquities Authority, on \\\"Preserving the Dead Sea Scrolls\\\" in the Mumford Room, LM-649, James Madison Memorial Building, The Library of Congress, 101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, D.C.     ------    NOTE A: For more information about admission to the symposium, please contact, in writing, Dr. Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, African and Middle Eastern Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540.  -30-\",\" I have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).

(The _phone_ company keeps records, but this  information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave relay station).  This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications encryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by an eavesdropper? \",\" There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill. That's the point, after all.   That's because these \\\"peer-reviewed\\\" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models. You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\".  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.   Probably one of the dumber remarks you've made. \",\"A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars,  or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of 5-3.  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to play.  Tonight, on the air on the Stars TV telecast, announcer Al Shaver, the voice of the North Stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to  Dallas.  Shaver, when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him), \\\"What will you do now?\\\" responded, \\\"First I'm going to get me a new pair of slippers.

(I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service. Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called \\\"becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some.\\\"     Don't say \\\"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time    on.\\\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.

As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.

Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.

However,   if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their   checking line against these \\\"finesse\\\" players - well then   let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the  jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.  In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass, I might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name, (still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.    If this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps  (for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.    A ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for me) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case, yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike.   On the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing illegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).  Like almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary. \",\" That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems because of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things! \",\" I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)\",\"I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $250 Max for it,  what i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter.  Or at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card.  I need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance  increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the  32 and 64 kb Cache worths the price difference ?. And what's the best  price i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible  $).   I have an Ethernet card for the LC with fpu.

It has also been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.  What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.  1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid?  2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.  3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the \\\"right\\\" course of action?

I'm : particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any : current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a : normal IF filter can be used?  : Any suggestions?  : John    What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the 10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.    I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \\\"external\\\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \\\"beacon\\\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \\\"target\\\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.

Nanci\",\"From article <1993Apr16.162950.25849@newsgate.sps.mot.com>, by markm@bigfoot.sps.mot.com (Mark Monninger):   A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, \\\"Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.\\\"  The deal went through with no problems.\",\"WOW !!!!

But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \\\"SOUL TRAVEL\\\")            REPLACE blind faith.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.   Contents:  * What is a one-way hash function? * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.? * What are MD4 and MD5? * What is Snefru?   * What is a one-way hash function?    A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and   produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally   impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't   determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not   even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also   computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the   same hash.    A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an   encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash   function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are   relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user   is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,   and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the   signature can do the same thing.    Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?    There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a   very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which   isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it   a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption   functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have   hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1   if and only if X = H(M).    A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private   decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the   previous question, have public hashing and public verification.   Digital signature functions have private hashing and public   verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,   but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.    Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to   be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real   difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key   isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend   rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing   ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.  * What are MD4 and MD5?    MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.   Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is   available from [FTPMD].    Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft   RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some   people refer to it as MD5.  * What is Snefru?\",\"Greetings!

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to \\\"have hardware which will blow anything else away\\\", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as \\\"Bill\\\" and claims to be the \\\"MS-iah\\\".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of \\\"interpersonal computing\\\" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling \\\"I want to welcome you to the 'Next World' \\\".\",\"I wonder if anyone can tell me whether or not I can create a bitmap of any size?

But I just cannot get the right bitmap image.  I changed the width/height to 32x32 and used the same value string (padded with zero byets to make up to the right size) and got the image.

Bob   --\",\"Windows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software.   WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\"Two LH Research SM11-1 power supplies (SM10 series).  1000W, 5V, 200A (currently wired for 115VAC)  Control lines: +/- sense, on/off, pwr.fail, high/low margin, and current monitor.

If you want something hot, you need to heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.    You'de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking up on \\\"blue ice\\\" blocks.   Same as above.  Not enough \\\"punch\\\" in them to keep/get things cold/hot.

Thanks. abou@sun.soe.clarkson.edu\",\"  Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"   ARGHHHHHHHHHh  READ THE MEMOS!!!!

My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the existance of Jesus, only of his activities.    I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source).\",\"I thought that the Clipper Chip that was posted to t.p.g (sorry, I lost the original post) was a joke.

After the belligerants are subdued, it would require an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to die. A price I am unwilling to even consider.   There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned). It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.

Unfortunatly, nothing about that feature is mentioned in the manual. Can anybody help me?\",\"  Yes, victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.   I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky.   Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.

If you then amend it to        THINGS DESCRIBED BY CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE DO NOT EXIST  then we've come to something which is plainly false.  Failures in description are merely failures in description.  (I'm not an objectivist, remember.)  \",\"I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now.  I must say this machine is really fast!  The hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm.  However, I still have a few complaints: - when I restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop   pattern) jerks up and down for a few times. - the Quantum 170 drive is noisy  Overall, I highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!  --\",\"===============================================================================   I'm looking for the E_Mail Address of the Caere Corporation.

But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\" You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \\\"The Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,\\\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6\\\" starting about 10\\\" above the bulb.  Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway through.  If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub for this stuff.  gerald.belton@ozonehole.com    * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.                        \",\"Organization: \\\"A World of Information at your Fingertips\\\" Keywords:     Craig,  You should still consider the Targa+.

I need information on scaring.

Louis \",\"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was  very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.\",\"     Sheesh!

More recent scholarship from the  # #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/ # #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in  # #the South prior to the Civil War. #  # This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital #  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern #  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference  #  in the capital to labor intensity.  Capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.  Slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not in 1850.  # #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's - # #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the  # #South.   #  # That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because #  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without #  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have  #  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come  #  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, #  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and #  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing  #  agriculturalists.

Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_ #  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.  This assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the North.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive threat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  #  Craig A.

I don't know what a \\\"low grade\\\" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \\\"high-Ti\\\" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).\",\"  I'd have to say that I have a problem with any organization,  religious or not, where the idea that _simple speech_ such as this is the basis for a crime.\",\" >When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows  >are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server  >to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors.

[snip]   The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).  It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec (which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft) ... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).  Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.  CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The price of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines.

However, if you use the method of  copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to  the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the  protection.  One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape  for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an  extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.

We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good advice.  We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk, and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some problems:  The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive.  If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each (1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?  Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?  What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them installed in the other disk.  The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.  It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If \\\"poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,\\\" this typical historical pattern would not hold.

And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined...   No, but mating practices are a special case.  I'll have to think about it some more.   Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural system is a subset of the objective ones.   I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).

People might quibble about what \\\"intrinsically\\\" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a  different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm \\\"what is man that you [God]  should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower  than the angels\\\"?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an \\\"attaboy\\\" from the  Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.   I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other people see this.    (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)  Your point about how \\\"hard\\\" other religions are is a good one, just  as your \\\"Parting Question\\\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \\\"submission\\\". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \\\"God\\\" is impersonal.  Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.  Are there any former (or present) \\\"Eastern Religion\\\" members here  who could comment?\",\"  Hey Pal!  Who're you calling litte?

If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war.   Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's about all we have to go on, isn't it?    And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring Christian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that in the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.  \",\"Does anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get a VGA passthrough?

You know, it's a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way.  It's ridiculously expensive, and potentially toxic. The trouble is that it isn't toxic enough, so it gets abused by quacks.   The only good thing about nystatin is that it's (relatively) cheap and when taken orally, non-toxic.  But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect, so unless it were given IV, it would be without any effect on your sinuses.  I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you.  That would solve the \\\"yeast\\\" problem once and for all.   Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms.  Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket?

What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran?  Also, the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either.

Karl  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\",\"I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris. . . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just \\\"tell\\\" with internal drives?    I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems?  One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?   the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?\",\" Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse before.  Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

(There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \\\"thermal  pollution\\\" de-icing a river, said, \\\"Up here, we view heat as a resource\\\".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\",\":  : I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, : and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part : in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.  Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me via email and let me know: 1.

It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence. There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and Alomar is not a home run hitter.   Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.  Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Can you recommend any good books, journals, or microstrip circuit design software. . all help appreciated\",\"  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).  And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of \\\"Let his blood be upon our hands\\\" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \\\"Mene, mene, tekel, peres?\\\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: \\\"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \\\"Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\\\"  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \\\"well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.\\\"  He said \\\"Follow me.\\\"  His message is NOT \\\"I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\\\"  \\\"Our great God and Savior\\\" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'. Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)   \",\"What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord. The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy. Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.  (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)  Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

The estimated population  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were  Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.  Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third  of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the   Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians  as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,  however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000  inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character   notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian   Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the   southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\\\"   (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They   found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border   into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole   length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to   Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain   plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of   Tartar villages.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces, massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly  people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated  the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between  1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today  in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide  that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought  they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the  Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian  terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle  resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that  they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia  today.  A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri  town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to  have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military  operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the  Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been  massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten  and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed  the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian  insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City  hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant  were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to  condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its  sovereignty.

I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.  Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?  Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many fractions aso ?  I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of these could make arabs stall the negotiations.    I like California oranges. And the feelings may get sharper at the table.    Regards,\",\"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them).     Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.     His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:   - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.   - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.    This stuck them as strange, until now...      Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip:    - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.    - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency     of the government.    - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.    - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or     changing the keys themselves.    - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.  Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. However he told me a little:   - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is    secure.   - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate    the following:      - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but       Mr. Melnick stated \\\"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\\\")      - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.      - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).      - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that       it is _adujustable_ and is \\\"More than adequate for security.\\\"      - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.      - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the       hardware chip.      - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced       enough, which probably won't happen]).      - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted       data into \\\"blocks.\\\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.      - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!    Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact them, they can be reached at..  Secure Communications Technology 8700 Georgia Ave. Suite 302 Silver Spring, MD  (301) 588-2200  I talked to Mr. Bryen who represents the company. He can answer any questions you have.     Any factual errors occurring in this write up are my own and I apologize for them ahead of time.   \",\"   [ ... ]   To which I say: Hear, hear.  Motion seconded.  Hovig  \",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".   Petri \",\" You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after reading Deuteronomy chapter 28.\",\" Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include: psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.  There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try different things, some of which seem to help.  Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days. Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.\",\"  Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences. The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case. You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits?  There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently, because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting.   Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much  freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket).   By \\\"cannot now be justified\\\" I guess you mean that you personally don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion so important?   Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the  incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.\",\" In the \\\"sex ed\\\" portion of the  high school \\\"health\\\" course I took in 1984, it was impressed that the only 100% positive way to *not* get pregnant was to *not* have sex.  Other methods of contraception were discussed, in the framework of a chart which showed both the _expected_ failure rate (theoretical, assumes no mistakes) and the _actual_ failure rate (based on research). Top of the chart was something like this:    Method                  Expected         Actual   ------                 Failure Rate    Failure Rate  Abstinence                 0%              0%    And NFP (Natural Family Planning) was on the bottom. The teacher even said, \\\"I've had some students tell me that they can't use anything for birth control because they're Catholic. Well, if you're not married and you're a practicing Catholic, the *top* of the list is your slot, not  the *bottom*.

I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc.   I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said, I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go  for the extra cubes.    I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note  and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I  couldn't afford a Duc.  Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, I'll probably be getting a 900SS next year...  - Mark  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mark S.

If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.   Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.     Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me \\\"you have to make room for the kids\\\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.    Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.   Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)    Coffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.    You? Nah...   He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I\\\"m tempted to make an exception.  But I won't. \",\"I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember  a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length  is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When  there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between  the lists. --King \\\"Sparky\\\" Banaian    |\\\"No taxes:  No new taxes, kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu   |no old taxes, we are taxed Dept. of Economics, Pitzer College  |enough.\\\" -- Rep.

That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not  when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence  shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the  \\\"distrustful ones\\\".   Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.   I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard  on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed  today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found  unusual.   Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian  in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one,  will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long  news story about that documentary.   Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right  to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I  were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change  my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie  fabricated by the \\\"distrustful ones\\\".  \",\"Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little easier for the playoffs.

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\" Gee, I never knew Valentine made a comment about how Viola signing with Boston was gonna bring a World Series title to Boston.

You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?  Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good.  I use the phrase \\\"happened to be\\\" advisedly. Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to \\\"turn it up a notch\\\" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.

He agreed,  and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not  propose it?  I asked.

Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\\\\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\\\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\\\\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \\\\winorig\\\\*.* >\\\\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with \\\"real pirates\\\" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....

On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \\\"The world hates him without reason.\\\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.\",\"   For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals                                            505-530-6563    For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico                                       508-277-6563                                    ftp from                               ptrg.eece.unm.edu      Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password                cd /pub/khoros/release     That will get you to the right place.\",\"Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?  Client Software: SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5 Server Hardware: Sun IPC Server Software: SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)  A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following things:      1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience. Beware of predictions like \\\"The volcano will erupt tomorrow!\\\"  Don't follow the preacher because of such statements that come true.  Note also, that if I'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say \\\"his mother predicted he would die.\\\"  Of course, his father may have said \\\"he 'll make good money because of his hobby\\\" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \\\"Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\\\" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has come.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if you can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.  Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.  -leo \",\"Responding to the moderator:   Yes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"   Hmmmmmm.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.

Internet drafts on Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) describe a standard   under revision for six years delineating the official protocols for   email encryption.  The standard has only recently stabilized and   implementations are being developed.    - RFC-1421: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail:      Part I: Message Encryption and Authentication Procedures.'' J.     Linn <104-8456@mcimail.com>    - RFC-1422: ``Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail: Part     II: Certificate-Based Key Management'' S.

Cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  It's written in PERL, and is   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).   Karl Barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and   modifications. Also, most remailer operators mentioned above are   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites   become operational. Address all points in the section   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to   advertising your service.  You should be committed to the long-term   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.  _____ <4.8> What are references on privacy in email?

For more   information send email to crosslink@athena.mit.edu.   MISCELLANEOUS =============  _____ <5.1> What is ``digital cash''?    With digital encryption and authentication technologies, the   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be   realized.  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may   be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an   economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum   (~Dec.1992).    An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus   <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the   cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:      ::     command: help          user@host    where `user@host' is your email address.      _____ <5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?    These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,   especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and   patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also   the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.     _____ <5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?    From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:    > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were   > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant   > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or   > their opinions.    See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.    See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.  _____ <5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?    Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself.    Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the   proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,   typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and   receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An   anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following   commands in the subject line:      subscribe     unsubscribe     help  _____ <5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?    `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information   or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in   operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet   posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ   for alt.security.        Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic   Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First   International Symposium on National Security & National   Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:    > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep   > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If   > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting   > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little   > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,   > but you may differ...  _____ <5.6> What are `identity daemons'?      RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local   communication socket (a connection of this type is established   during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement   it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to   anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system   adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.  _____ <5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?     Remailing/Posting   -----------------      - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.   - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET     postings.   - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,     encrypted addresses, etc.)   - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and     remailer site chaining.      General   -------      - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the     general public and their governments.   - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies      by systems designers into     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.   - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement     agencies.   - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to     strengthening and protecting it.   ISSUES ======  _____ <6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?    From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:    > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic   > media which connect us.  Computer-based communication media like   > electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis   > of new forms of community.  These communities without a single,   > fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an   > electronic frontier.   >    > While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give   > structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like   > newspapers, books, and telephones, the new digital media do not   > so easily fit into existing frameworks.  Conflicts come about as   > the law struggles to define its application in a context where   > fundamental notions of speech, property, and place take   > profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the   > threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies,   > even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the   > workplace and the home.   >    > The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help   > civilize the electronic frontier; to make it truly useful and   > beneficial not just to a technical elite, but to everyone; and to   > do this in a way which is in keeping with our society's highest   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and   > communication.      EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor, founder of   Lotus software, and John Barlow, lyricist for the Grateful Dead   rock band.  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization   involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve   Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector   Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.      In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated   November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented   Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly   by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in    ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):    > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to   > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create   > a consumer-oriented, public information network. Please let me or   > my staff know what policies you and others in the computer   > industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating   > a reasonably priced, widely available network in which   > competition is open and innovation rewarded.  I also want to   > learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten   > to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on   > structuring the information and communications networks of the   > future....I ask your help in gaining input from the computer   > industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will   > bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the   > information services industry.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/eff/about-eff   ---     A file of basic information about EFF including goals, mission,     achievements, and current projects.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues   since ~1982.  The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,   Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation   against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other   U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation   on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,   NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in   Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on   Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and   caller identification.    CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available   via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For   more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.     (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions   here.)  _____ <6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?    In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.      (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):    > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success.    > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of   > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of   > jurisdictions.    Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated   instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a   crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal   search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of   Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST   by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science   Fiction Magazine:    > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional   > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the   > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,   > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin   > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place.    > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that   > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.    FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed   on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier   Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe   Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:      > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret   > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal   > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment.    >    > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in   > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke   > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer   > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first   > case to challenge the practice.    >    > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine   > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that   > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the   > special Secret Service school on computer crime.    >    > \\\"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what   > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\\\" asked Sparks. \\\"An hour?    >    > \\\"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to   > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything   > taken?    >    > \\\"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had   > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen   > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?    >    > \\\"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material   > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\\\"    >    > Foley replied, \\\"No, sir,\\\" but the judge offered his own answer.    >    > \\\"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go   > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\\\"    >    > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier    > Foundation in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by    > Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large   > part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown.      ftp.eff.org   ===========      /pub/cud/papers/sundevil   ---     A collection of information on Operation SunDevil by the Epic     nonprofit publishing project.

ISDN is a high-speed data communications standard that utilizes   existing copper telephone lines, and is a possible inexpensive and   intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone   networks.  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and   video transmission applications.  G.

FOOTNOTES =========   _____ <7.1> What is the background behind the Internet?     The article ``Internet'' in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce   Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> contains general and nontechnical   introductory notes on origins of the Internet, including the role   of the RAND corporation, the goal of network resilience in face of   nuclear attack, MIT, UCLA, ARPANET, TCP/IP, NSF, NREN, etc.:    > ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989, a happy victim of its    > own overwhelming success.  Its users scarcely noticed, for   > ARPANET's  functions not only continued but steadily improved.    > The use of  TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now   > global.  In 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only   > four nodes in the  ARPANET  network.  Today there are tens of   > thousands of  nodes in  the Internet,  scattered over forty-two   > countries, with more coming  on-line every day.   Three million,   > possibly four million people use  this gigantic   > mother-of-all-computer-networks.      >    > The Internet is especially popular among scientists, and is    > probably the most important scientific instrument of the late    > twentieth century.   The  powerful, sophisticated access that it    > provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped   > up the pace of scientific research enormously.     >    > The Internet's pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular,    > almost ferocious.  It is spreading faster than cellular phones,   > faster  than fax machines.  Last year the Internet was growing at   > a rate of  twenty percent a *month.*  The number of `host'   > machines with direct  connection to TCP/IP has been doubling   > every year since  1988.   The Internet is moving out of  its   > original base in military and  research institutions,  into   > elementary and high schools, as well as into  public libraries   > and the commercial sector.

Thanks in advance!\",\"     Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\",\" ##It should be noted that NAMBLA has not been present in the ##other 600 or so gay parades in the nation.

I have used Works and Windows Write. The output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it?? Thanks\",\"  Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.  This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\"   Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support escape sequences for it.

If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device, or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the  'sad mac' sound.   This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.

Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive game than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their part of the offense, but that's another issue.)  That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to: X X  ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate X  obfuscate@toad.com X X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'. X X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however. X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC. X X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry X       must be sent in a separate Email letter. X X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.   X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed. X X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user, X       special owner or group) are not allowed. X     X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \\\"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\\\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\\\"string\\\"];   <--- use \\\"string\\\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program. X X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from X    a short example!

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \\\"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\\\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \\\"s/... \\\\(19[0-9][0-9]\\\\)$/\\\\1/\\\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\\\"The New Hackers Dictionary\\\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.

TRANSLATION   The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.                                    PURPORT   All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.   As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.  Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports, consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments of the gov't, though this is not the general case.   From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \\\"ultimate borders\\\" (is this a game like \\\"ultimate frisbee\\\"?) extending into  other countries.   Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.   If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron. That having been said, I deny the above.  You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious bias.  Questions of the sort \\\"Is it true that you entered your mother's vagina?\\\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions upon Israel.

The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.

They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\\\" That's when the real  slaughter began,\\\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to survive. \\\"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\\\"     \\\" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\\\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.     One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case. If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.  Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it would be contrary to the internet comercial use.   Now you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was the fact of association between the company and the post that was important. The typeface etc is inconsequential.    If you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick Staffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that  advocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it directly.   Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to call for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part of what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example if a Microsoft employee were to post \\\"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\\\" from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has  political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political platform for his views.    ah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.    Your article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature and pretty well damn all else.     Are you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments on the substantive case?  The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already. The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.  Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.   The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law. The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.     Funny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in rejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion is unprovable I left it at that.   So far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your own. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.  Plus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this problem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret session and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the issues are half as simple as you imply.   I don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that of proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat. \",\"THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993                               PRESS BRIEFING                        BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS                            The Briefing Room    1:04 P.M. EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.                Q   Could we do this on the lawn?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out  to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.              Q   Is the stimulus package dead?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.                Q   Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You  said it was a good visit, but no compromise.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk  with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there  were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very  good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as  well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe  Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not  speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the  President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close  of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the  President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked  about that yesterday afternoon.              At the close of that discussion they said that they  would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator  was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific  compromises made on either side, they did say that they would  continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.              Q   Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are  both making concessions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that  phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said  consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.   He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to  take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to  make those adjustments.              Q   On the subject of a VAT --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.              Q   Can we stay on this for one more minute?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.              Q   We have a problem with the five minutes --              Q   I know no decisions have been made, but what would  lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go  down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said  this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a  number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked  at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been  made.              Q   To follow, have they done that directly through  him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President  about it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although  there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the  VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.              Q   At the meetings that he's had with his own task  force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the  possible options would be?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been  presented for a decision, no.              Q   Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an  option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of  briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the  President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.                Q   You're not saying he didn't know it was being  considered, though, are you?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.              Q   He knew that.              Q   But has he discussed that with his advisers?   That's what I'm asking.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being  considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been  over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I  don't even know that it's --              Q   But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at  this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're  getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is  considered --               Q   Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed  it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just  repeated.               Q   George, is there any concern here that as a result  of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if  it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out  the way it did, that there may now be the development of a  credibility gap on this issue and others?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is  now public knowledge that this is being considered.              Q   Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute  statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it  was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it  come out not from you people, but --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out  from the administration.  What are you talking about?              Q   What I'm saying is, though, that the President said  he would let us know.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   You people then said -- you said, I believe, that  it's not going to be on the program.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.              Q   On March 25th.               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.              Q   Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out  by rooting around in the fine print of an interview              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do  a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is -- (laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys  write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the  Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right  here, and AP story -- \\\"Clinton wants more money for spying.\\\"              Q   What about his remark that if it were being  considered, he'd tell us about it?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned,  and he'd let you know.              Q   And did he?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say  this morning?              Q   It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of  me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of  Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his  administration.  That is his administration policy.              Q   Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they  orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they  answered the questions.              Q   You're saying here that it didn't have to be  dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were  considering it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.   Painfully clear.              Q   Was there a particular political strategy in making  it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being  considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they  answered that it was being considered.              Q   George, The New York Times --              Q   Why do it yesterday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.              Q   The New York Times reports today that Secretary  Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and  oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures  in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill,  but which turned out to be totally false.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally  false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor  Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they  say that.               Q   The question is, is the President concerned about  behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he  doing about it, if so?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a  mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the  matter.              Q   Isn't that the same information that goes to the  President?              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of  information.  I think that's where the confusion was.              Q   When did you all first learn about this mistake  that was made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.              Q   And as far as you know, is the President aware of  it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.              Q   And was he aware of it before he read about it in  The New York Times?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.              Q   Did you ever hear about it before this morning?   Anything?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.              Q   Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on  this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both  statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that  mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said  it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.              Q   Did they drop it -- is this something that you  choose to spin or make an issue of?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of  work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to  get this jobs package going.              Q   If I could go back to the stimulus package for a  minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an  amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment  would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in  the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting  that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no  changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the  timing like that.              Q   Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer  this week than you were last week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going  to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make  adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the  votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's  going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes  deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.              Q   Has there been any indication that this situation  has changed?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on  it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.              Q   George, last week you said that there are -- or  various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go  through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because  he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the  compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could  accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've  realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted  to talk to the President about the stimulus package.              Q   He initiated the conversation?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact,  the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You  say he's making --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly  what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that  there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise,  and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President  doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get  it through, he will.              Q   Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was  working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before  the actual vote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.              Q   Today?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will  happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward  with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come  forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it  passed.              Q   As we understood his conversations with Dole, the  first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you  tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase  is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how  detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the  package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday  afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today  in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator  Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific  compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.   And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that  we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.              Q   What are the follow-up discussions if not the  President and Dole?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going  to talk to Senator Dole.              Q   Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right,  how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the  President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation  in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.              Q   Did they discuss actual numbers?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they  talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked  about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the  level of this many x-billion dollars.               Q   Does Dole have to sign off before there is a  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.              Q   Did the White House have anything to do with the  protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole  was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.              Q   And has the President been in touch with Senators  Kohl or Feingold?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them,  no.              Q   George, is the President considering the more  palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the  haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going  to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves  having to pay for the have-nots?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that  the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his  budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your  question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.              Q   George, on the subject of accuracy in information,  you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money  that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is  not true.  It's actually waste water money.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for  Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee.               Q   But it would not affect the drinking water problem  because it's waste water money, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment  overall.               Q   But the implication from your statement the other  day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.   Would you agree that's not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I  know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.              Q   A leftover question from this morning, which was,  when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating  on a VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just  don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between  the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.                Q   So sometime since March 25th?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know  the exact date.              Q   George, the President this morning mentioned that  some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the  National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax  being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel  that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed,  or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already  proposed?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to  say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is  being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.   The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that.               Q   But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't  be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the  income tax, for instance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on  that.              Q   In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress,  Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you  think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it  have a chance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea.               Q   Is that a consideration whether you all put it  forward?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration  if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration  now.              Q   You said at the beginning of the briefing that  circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under  consideration.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to  this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something  that has to be considered.              Q   Those are the circumstances that have changed?   That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled  it out that groups have asked it to be considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said.               Q   Is that true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin  taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the  deliberations.              Q   But, George --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as  the President said, groups came forward and said this is something  you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it.               Q   Is that the only thing that's changed since his  prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Can you explain how those groups -- how that  information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading  the newspaper or did groups make presentations?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know,  the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.              Q   But this is the President's knowledge that these  groups had come forward.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what  was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been  published positions in the newspapers.              Q   Have certain groups briefed him on the group's  presentations to them?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him  -- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the  working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these  groups.              Q   What kind of arguments did the groups make that  were persuasive enough that the President would change the position  that he had enunciated previously?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had  longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance  health care.              Q   The President wasn't aware of those longstanding  positions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.   Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the  basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.              Q   What we're trying to figure out here -- you're  telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this  change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February  and now --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't  necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.              Q   I know, but the President said that it was off the  table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's  changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also  describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.   If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been  made to the President --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the  presentations to the health care task force.              Q   There's no relationship at all between the fact  that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he  favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested  that they would produce all the revenue.              Q   Well, he suggested that he thought that those were  appropriate ways to finance health care.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that  he said anything to refute that.              Q   But, in fact, has the task force discovered that  there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind  of core benefits --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task  force ever suggested that there would.              Q   George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break  his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his  programs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical  situation.                 Q   But does that promise -- would that promise not to  raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him  from seeking a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions  on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the  implications then.              Q   Which specific groups can you cite -- business,  labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task  force has prompted this consideration?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just  don't have that.              Q   George, can you tell us to what extend these other  alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or  other financing options are also still on the table and what these  options are?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force  and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking  at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that  there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not  going to comment --              Q   What's the scope --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on  them, no.              Q   What's the scope of the need?  How much are you  talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task  force is looking at.              Q   Since there's not going to be any briefing on the  Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the  President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his  task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and  the remark about market access at the press conference?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?              Q   Does no mean yes.              Q   Yes and no.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the  Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question  about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when  he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that  certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the  President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and  the U.S. that we want to do something about.              Q   Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he  suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in  terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state  our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit  very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your  characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.              Q      that we need specific export targets, specific  numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with  Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad  discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into  those specifics until after the meeting.              Q   Why?              Q    That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or  not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical  targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of  hopeless that this is going to change very much?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must  have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not  want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.              Q   But does the President believe that their stimulus  package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants  to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister  Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.              Q   How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to  be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary  Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do  more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to  work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to  press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I  think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and  we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral  packages.              Q   Do you think the Japanese need to do more?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work  with all our allies to do as much as we can.              Q   Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today  Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on  the Bosnia policy.  And he said, \\\"It's a rather emotional response.\\\"         MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.              Q   Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White   House condone that kind of remark?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary  Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also  that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find  answers for.               Q   But that specific -- \\\"rather emotional response\\\" --  specific term?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.              Q   In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with  the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it  good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now  to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?              Q   To take stronger action, to take military action --  air strikes, anything that can be done?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what  must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as  you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms  embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase  pressure at this time.              Q   What is your response to the critics who would say  that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain  the presidency?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard  for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard  for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the  arms embargo.              Q   You were putting great store in Vance and Owen  getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said  that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that  change your thinking?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to  whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to  say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions  and talking about the arms embargo.              Q   A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She  said she would be able to provide some administration officials who  could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are  you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.              Q   That's exactly what she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But  what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of  evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are  connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and  we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have  an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute,  what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact  effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods  into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What  kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't  know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at  all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.              Q   Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be  released?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.   And it will be probably later today.              Q   Is the President considering signing an executive  order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work  force as part of the gay rights march here next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal  for that at this time, not that I know of.              Q   It's something that the President promised during  the campaign that he would do.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't  think it's anything that's on his plate right now.              Q   Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point  on this issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.   I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian  community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of  different groups and communities.              Q   Do you know if that's scheduled --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.              Q   Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)              Q   It's a good thing you asked.              Q   Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.              Q   How long --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.              Q   Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?   (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I  don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.              Q   Environmental groups have asked him to make a major  speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but  I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to  give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not  exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like  that.              Q   Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of  the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific  timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under  discussion and something we've been working on.              Q   Campaign finance reform?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.              Q   Do you think it will be next week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   The biodiversity treaty is something you're working  on?  I missed the question.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.   He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know  anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working  on.              Q   Do you know what organizations might be represented  in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.              Q   Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out  of town on the day of the march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate  meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a  speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston  on Sunday, as he did last year.              Q   Would you have told us if she had not pressed you  on the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?              Q   On the gays.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the  President's schedule for the day, certainly.              Q?     George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is  that Sunday?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.              Q   And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one  day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how  long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't  know.              Q   You would have made the gay meeting public, right?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting  -- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you  about it.              Q   I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the  first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in  the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's  not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)              Q      at the White House in the Bush administration  gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White  House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make  sure --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do  anything like that.              Q   Certainly not.              Q   What marching orders did the President give to  General Vessey?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for  about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was  he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will  obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.   The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting  and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes  in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's  response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look  into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on  remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to  military archives.                And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the  activities of the joint commission and on the document.              Q   Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis  at this stage?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's  also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the  Vietnamese.              Q   A number of Defense officials have been saying that  they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact,  non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to  as Americans from time to time.  Do people --               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final  determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we  have it, we'll make a judgment.              Q   I know you don't have any final determination, but  given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that  that's a likely possibility?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize  it in any way until the review is complete.              Q   George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech  in Boston?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.               Q   Is the President going to have a press conference  tomorrow with Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.   Yes, I expect, yes.              Q   Was Toon in with Vessey?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.               Q   He was in on the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey,  and the answer is yes.               Q   Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal  report this morning the President's distressed about some of his  press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I  think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied  that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would  point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than  any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --              Q   How many questions?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77  occasions.              Q   How many were while he was jogging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very  good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the  article also implied that these questions were only answered at  tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.   He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval  Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to  questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --              Q   Oval Office press conference -- when was that?               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the -- East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval  Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the  Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington  Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local  television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The  Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather.  He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and  Connecticut --              Q   Can you address the question of the attitude?  The  article implies that he doesn't --              Q   Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)              Q   Did you really get blamed for that Post story?              Q   The story is that you -- are you held responsible  for it.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment  about this.              Q   Are you denying that the President has shown  displeasure publicly?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the  discussions between the President and myself.              Q   Did the President write that letter to Chris  Webber?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?              Q   The letter to the University of Michigan basketball  player?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.              Q   That is an authentic letter?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Since the President first talked about the VAT in  February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should  be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.   Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a  proposal he hasn't made.              Q   George, does the President have some agenda for  this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a  general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about  including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.              Q   The military issue?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.              Q   Is he using this event to name the AIDS --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.              Q   George, what specifically is the President doing to  prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had  general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the  Trade Representative and others.              Q      report yet?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report  referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him  today.              Q   He was?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Does he intend to use any of these instances that  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the  report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press  hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.              Q   In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was  that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he  feels that way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the  record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again,  I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The  thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the  President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he  has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent  history.        Q   Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.                THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:34 P.M.

Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those \\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?  Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.  ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush  fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu \\\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\\\" Grafitti, Paris, 1968  TANSTAAFL!

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.

Even if we assume that these \\\"trusted agents\\\" are really entering  a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the  time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not  doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry  at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be  punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program  the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they  are feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it can't be trusted.

A technician examined it and  pronounced the disk drive unusable.  My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed \\\"successfully\\\", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that \\\"you need to upgrade to a    16550\\\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term \\\"16550\\\" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers \\\"8250\\\" or \\\"16450\\\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \\\"N\\\" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the \\\"A\\\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-\\\"A\\\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the \\\"+\\\" is important) sells for $89.95.

Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above \\\"CBR_128000\\\".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they \\\"may\\\" be solved in Windows \\\"4.0\\\".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of \\\"TurboCom\\\", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \\\"Windows Sources\\\" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a \\\"power user\\\" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \\\"sort of\\\" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

However, this placed the computer into SCSI mode, that is it acted as an external hard disk whenever i switched the computer on.  I've asked an engineer in London to assemble a new Cable for me. But he's taken 14 weeks and has yet to find the solution, out of sheer laziness. And I know that a cable exists to solve the problem.  If you know the solution.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated \\\"hanged oneself\\\", and a couple were more explicit  and stated that \\\"apacgw\\\" means specifically \\\"kill yourself by hanging.\\\" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \\\"apacgw\\\" is \\\"strangle, throttle or choke\\\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word \\\"apagchw\\\" has two root words: \\\"gchw\\\" is the \\\"to strangle\\\" root, and the root word \\\"apo\\\" means literally \\\"away.\\\" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word \\\"apagello\\\" means to send a message).  \\\"Apo\\\" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word \\\"apokteiuo,\\\" which means \\\"to kill.\\\" In literal meaning the word \\\"apacgw\\\" means \\\"to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,\\\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word \\\"apacgw\\\" does mean \\\"to hang,\\\" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means \\\"to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging.\\\" He then notes the the use of \\\"apacgw\\\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of \\\"apacgw\\\" as being used to explicitly mean \\\"suicide by hanging.\\\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of \\\"death,\\\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of \\\"apacgw\\\" (ie: Since the word \\\"apacgw\\\" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \\\"apacgw\\\":   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\\\" the the Hebrew say \\\"and died\\\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \\\"and died\\\", the correct translation would still be \\\"apacgw,\\\" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing \\\"apacgw\\\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal \\\"an iniquity,\\\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas' actions \\\"an iniquity\\\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      \\\"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him \\\"Buy what we need for the feast\\\"; or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.\\\"  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that \\\"apacgw\\\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \\\"Field of Blood\\\" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.

They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.    I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're cold, its a hitch.    The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he's changed his stance so much.  I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here?  Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse.  IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform \\\"gas insertions\\\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge.  Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the \\\"gas insertion\\\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.  Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.  The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are.  Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my  very soul.  John\",\"   as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this.

If you have questions, you want to send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan           Software Tools to help with RSI       -------------------------------   This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI. This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.     Richard Donkin                            Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk               Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct) Fax: +44 71 251 2853  Changes in this version:       Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool       for Windows.   TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.  Includes 'At Your Service'.       Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)     Available from:  Escape Ergonomics, Inc  1111 W. El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.   Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.      Comments:  The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better  to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to  measure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff  is very good and includes some summaries of research papers,  as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company   to pay up for RSI management tools.        Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)     Available from:  RAN Enterprises  One Woodland Park Dr.  Haverhill, MA  01830, US  Tel: 800-451-4487 (US only)     Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally  displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training   exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions  you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help   on workplace ergonomics.     Quote from their literature:   \\\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic  sets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O.

Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are  animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the  correct rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones  are included to some extent.  Online help.   Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based  on this.   Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                 Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.        (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).       Comments:  I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface  design is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.  expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only  tool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it  on your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!  Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\" I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for.

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:  A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national Instruments, at the same sample rate.  D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter.\",\" I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries).

It is easy for me to see it the those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything. There is a lot of money involved.   Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't necessarily make you the most objective source of information about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people who may or may not have Lyme.

Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didn't return.

It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!   In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back from you soon!  - Mike  ---        MI     KE   MIK    EMIK   EMI  K        \\\"Opinions expressed above        M I   K E  M   I  K        E   M         are my own and not that        M  I K  E  MIKEM  I  KEM   I   K         of 'Big Blue'\\\"        M   I   K  E   M   IKE M  IKE  MIKE\",\"DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]             Born 1972           Attended 9th Grade           Middle School No. 17            Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25           Microdistrict No. 3           Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came  home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period  in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was  the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and  other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first  cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and  on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring  that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.  When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped  by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.  The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to  the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking  passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not  taken for Armenians.  We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old  building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was  packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th  Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well. Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \\\"Death to the Armenians\\\" was written on the cars.  When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call  Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.  Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to  come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you  enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was  beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,  that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people  were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very  long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,  looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said  things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that  they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that  there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of  the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later  found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri Avakian was killed, too.  When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go  home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We  started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We decided she had already left.  We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address, but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . .  They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians  were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we  could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He  read the surname \\\"Danielian,\\\" turned the page, read \\\"Armenian,\\\" and that alone was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the  courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,  pushed some of the keys on the piano and said \\\"your death has tolled.\\\" They  had knives and steel truncheons.  I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents  and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken  outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind  her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began  beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.  We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their  balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they  strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I  lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from  their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is  broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an  ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.  We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and  try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,  they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our  neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the  window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a  result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken  away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken  away, and everything will be OK.  But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12  o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with  some \\\"assistants.\\\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,  and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are  in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.  In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events, before the 27th.  Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was  released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first  they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out  that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.  My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My  mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the  leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.  They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely.  At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out  later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called  specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address  and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address. Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the  phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He  denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father  answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he  called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of  automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had  never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20  years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he  was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.  My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was  two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural  projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and  later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from  the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in  a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.   My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon- sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join  the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School, and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.  Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home  of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.  While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped  . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too, about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .  Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia, was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to  recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of  Armenia.  After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they can do that.  I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches. After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I  think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.  You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had  even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move  here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and  that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct  a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies  in the hands of our government.

That is considered to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.  The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I don't see the big concern over the packaging because it probably isn't going to make that much difference  If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...

I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.\",\"X Window installation on a Sun4/470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as screen:0.0 and CG6 as screen:0.1.

The team which was later to prosecute him on criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's immunized testimony.

Born 1959    Teacher    Sumgait Secondary School No. 10    Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10    Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office     Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15    Microdistrict No. 3    Sumgait [Azerbaijan]  [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in   Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights  organizations - DD]  I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide our lives into \\\"before\\\" and ''after.\\\" We talk like that: that was before the war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live, it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even  sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened.  Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and  those who didn't.  That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you  could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.  My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.  In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our  apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in  his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely  locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a  hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people  who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.  My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my  mother, \\\"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\\\" But Mother was detached, pale, as  though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never  expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A  girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,  \\\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out  of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.\\\"  We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl  crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that  perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside  me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina  was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to  say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.  There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back, but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us  immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at  least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their  eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They  came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other  room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma  snatched the axe from behind and said, \\\"Tell them not to touch the children.  Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\\\" She said this to Father in Armenian.  There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They  understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,  they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \\\"You and  your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your  children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,  our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\\\" and  so on and so forth, \\\"and we came to do the same thing to you.\\\" This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They  were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people  among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,  all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm  a teacher.  So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took  him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there, because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all  but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were  doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off  Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \\\"I'm old enough to  be your mother! What are you doing?!\\\" He struck her. Now he's being held,  Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,  who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying  to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their  consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they  mustn't do it. She said, \\\"Come on, let's straighten this out, without  emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we  ever do to you?\\\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come  into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and  coming--said, \\\"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We  came here to kill them.\\\"  They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she  didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \\\"What did we do to you? What did we do to you?\\\" And even later, when she came to,  she said, \\\"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\\\"  That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only  broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they  were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain  nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do  was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,  they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but  didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they  could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,  kicking her, using anything they could find.  Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,  just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they  did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the  corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \\\"Let's take her  outside.\\\"  Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they  weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time  I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't  afraid of what would happen to them.  When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered  with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several  times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though  I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm  vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold  a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time  I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,  and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me  \\\"forget,\\\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.  At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and  despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering  to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a  really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I  suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly  I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I  just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the  ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was  still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all, they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe- cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.  I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.  Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't  need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had  even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth  living.  There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman  pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come  because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,  and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The  person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,  because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he  has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,  one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,  even during the investigation he almost called me \\\"daughter,\\\" he apologized,  although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that  I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my  words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes, but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never  forget it.  I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one  could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of  beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything. I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.  And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to  kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an  end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into  the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it  was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was  thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her  and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all  the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor  from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a  little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku, how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,  \\\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes, I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\\\" he says, \\\"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and  think I never shall again.\\\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw  everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken  the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He  saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the  brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that  they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to  do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I  After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and  Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even  remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry \\\"Marina!\\\" out to her, but could not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell  right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad  that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .  although her spirit was murdered . . .  At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that  mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his  name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \\\"Igor, help!\\\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were  taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and  Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the  neighbors.  And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,  something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.   Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,  they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out  onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already  sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone  said, \\\"She's already dead, let's throw her out.\\\" When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I  heard someone say in Azerbaijani: \\\"Don't kill her, I know her, she's a  teacher.\\\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an  accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and  I having opened my  eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had  been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only  remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately  I can't remember anything more.  What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot  about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that  women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan, if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in  Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that  all out later.  Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary  of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is  Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure, she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she  didn't want to endanger him. She said, \\\"He was there,\\\" and a little while  later, \\\"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.  No, it seems like it was he.\\\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see  us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something  entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought  groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started  crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting  us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned  him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.  The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is  right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the  investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone  to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.  Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she  bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her  wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's  lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A  Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a  special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm  a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,  and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.  After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.  He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \\\"Lady, if you give us all the gold  and money in your apartment we'll let you live.\\\" And Mamma told them where  the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and  everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other  over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one  another right then.  Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she  ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil- low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,  halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,  and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,  it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.  The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father  out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room, a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people  were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,  everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \\\"I was afraid  to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the  threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and  dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'.\\\" Mamma remembered one of the  criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,  out of one eye. She says, \\\"I realized that my death would come from that  person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\\\" Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.  I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina  was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out. I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.  But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones  I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the  ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and  that all of that would die with me.  At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I  didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \\\"Neighbor, is that you?\\\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been  taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to  take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he  started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.  The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in  the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the  presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities  or not. He said, \\\"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\\\" In the third  entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once  again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as  they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they  found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had  already taken the other.  Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I  identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an  Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian: \\\"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\\\" That's just what he said, \\\"those Azerbaijanis,\\\" as though he himself were not  Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \\\"I'll drive them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\\\"  That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the  person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened  to, the \\\"general,\\\" said that they were going to the third entryway.  Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.  Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.  He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.  But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.  I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt  from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find  anything. He told me, \\\"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the  neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're  alive.\\\" He told me all this in Armenian.  Then he returned to the others and said, \\\"What are you waiting for? Leave!\\\"  They said, \\\"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her  yourself. No, we want to do it to.\\\" He urged them on, but gently, not  coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \\\"Leave. What's the mat- ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\\\" And he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that  he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I  told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really good terms with them.  We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman  opened the door and immediately said, \\\"I'm an Azerbaijani.\\\" He said, \\\"I know.  Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\\\" She says, \\\"Fine, have her come in.\\\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I  had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into  tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a  half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \\\"Do you know where my family  is, what happened to them?\\\" She says, \\\"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid  to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see  who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\\\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my  neighbor says, \\\"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,  or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\\\" During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was  still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I  touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.  I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I  don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I  end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the  apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.  I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had  hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near  some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.  Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I  think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay  there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town  could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were  burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport  jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.  And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to  strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on  my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got  burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know  how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if  I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I  had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on  living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I  thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.  I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in  Afghanistan, he should protect her.  While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would  she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among  themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.  Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good  job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was  all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \\\"How come you get it? I  have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.  All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\\\" Another one says,  \\\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\\\" Then someone said  that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and left.  Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite  frequently, \\\"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let  them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\\\" Then they  said, \\\"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\\\" They repeated it  very often.         - - - reference for #008 - - -  [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,     Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by     Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash. The confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap between the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:  Rednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a  living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,  anyway) because they have never held education above basic  reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their  eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.  (They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage  of any group).

Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them, at AAA.   Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.   Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please let me know.)    But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.   Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as \\\"TWG\\\" without the caps. It's a losing strategy to say, \\\"We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.\\\" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  \\\"Two big bats.\\\" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.

That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.

I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \\\"C: drive\\\" and \\\"D: drive\\\" setup info rather than \\\"drive 1\\\" and \\\"drive 2\\\" like most others I've seen.

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict!

He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred  and respect the conditions under which it is revealed to me.\",\"I apologize for the long delay in getting a response to this posted. I've been working reduced hours the past couple of weeks because I had a son born (the day after Umar's article was posted, btw).  I did respond within a couple of days, but it turns out that a a coincidental news software rearrangement caused postings from this site to silently disappear rather than going out into the world.  This is a revision of that original response.   [this was in response to the claim that \\\"Rushdie made false statements about the life of Mohammed\\\", with the disclaimer \\\"(fiction, I know, but where is the line between fact and fiction?) - I stand by this distinction between fiction and \\\"false statements\\\"]   I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the \\\"ISLAM: a clearer view\\\" thread as well as the root of the \\\"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\\\" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the \\\"a clearer view\\\" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance \\\"Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores\\\"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that \\\"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\\\".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.   And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.  I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's essays, which is more than my correspondents have done.  Of course, you are more than welcome to do so.\",\"Just a shot here, but ya never know:  I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player  at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else.  If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.

When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window, giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.     The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables.     Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\",\"   I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler, but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies, the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however, if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board, the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.  Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed. Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since they're being so stinky.

The stuff they will stock are the ones that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But I'd be suprised if you do.

Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate     over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August     1789: \\\"What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the     establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...     Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of     the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order     to raise an army upon their ruins.\\\"  So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy our Liberties and Rights.  -- Charles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.edu Dept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931\",\" I'll throw in a vote for a Metzler \\\"economy\\\" tire, the ME77. Good for mid-size older bikes. Rated to 130mph. Wearing well and handles my 12 mile ride(twisties) to work well on the SR500. Costs a bit  more than the Chengs/IRC's etc, but still less than the Sport Metzlers for the newer bikes. Cost from Chaparral is about $60 for the front, and $70 for the rear.\",\"Enclosed are the rules, guidelines and related information for the 10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

To render obscure. X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated  X  their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) + X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n. X                obfuscatory adj. X  X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X  X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X  X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X  X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical  X    closing date for contests are in early May. X  X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c, X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access  X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may  X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at; X  X        judges@toad.com   -or-   ...!{sun,uunet,utzoo,pyramid}!hoptoad!judges X  X    Previous contest winners are available via anonymous ftp from X    ftp.uu.net under the directory /pub/ioccc.

Someday when Landon & Larry are not too  X    busy, they will actually get around to posting the first set of rules! X X    but other existing projects got in the way.

Its purpose: X X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details. X    * To applaud those with the best tricks. X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript X      programs ever. X X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide. X X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places. X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu. X X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork, X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award. X X    The judges will choose the winners of each category. X X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands.

It may have been their first production using live actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows, such as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.  The astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL airliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to look at.\",\"Hi,  I am programming in XView, SunOS 4.1.2 & OpenWindows 3.0.

I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts for learning ancient Hebrew, and how these compare with German educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  I can't figure out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to the U.S.  Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows]. What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis for comparison.

It    is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing    in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.    The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect    to join.  There are just so many.         Dean Kaflowitz  Yes, Christianity is convenient.

The Lord IS working in our community (the homosexual community, that is).  He's not asking us to change our sexual nature, but He is calling us to practice the morality that He established from the beginning.  Isn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue he can, especially homosexuality.  Let's reach the homosexuals for Christ.  Let's not try to change them, just need to bring them to Christ.  If He doesn't want them to be gay, He can change that.  If they are living a moral life, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives, who are we to tell them they have to change?

Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters. \",\"   I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they surely make up for in handling.

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

This \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the  Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.  IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the  affore-mentioned article)!  the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips for this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the  chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a  classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.  I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support  organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this Clipper Chip in any way that I can.  I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search warrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long to begin with!  -nate sammons\",\"I have a Sparc[12] with a german type 4 keyboard.

In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding this:  (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given this:   - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple  as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's  nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between  screens?   - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate  screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?  What are they; who sells them...   - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a  window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?   - Is there any way for the application to transparently see  multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware  only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?   - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a  system capable of using either multiple screens or a single  screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate  multiple screens instead)?    I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely  on providing config files which will specify for each  configuration the screen placement of each window in the  application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience  are more than welcome. \",\"Are there any vendors supporting pressure sensitive tablet/pen with X? I will appreciate any pointers.

[1]  Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization  Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan]   On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards  away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \\\"The Abyss.\\\"  Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at  the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation  whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it  was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if  someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There  were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that  large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well  mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an  Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that  they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do  to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded  a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move  over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone  recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.  It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.  Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,  people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the  auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and  gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \\\"OK, we've  scared them enough, let's leave.\\\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to  me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of  \\\"anasha\\\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like  they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing  had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful  films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We  could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,  and it was dark . . .  Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,  something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially  listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to  make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation  wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,  policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors  there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some  naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,  since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super  serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we  live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the  driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and  he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,  OK . . .  So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was  happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation  was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \\\"Ka-ra-bagh,\\\" they're not going  to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had  come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to  cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma  down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though  nothing had happened.  That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and  didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't guess.  On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,  Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and  no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that  morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda  Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, \\\"Don't they want Armenians? Well what  are they after, if they're already in that state?\\\" She says, no, nothing like  that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The  cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.  Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy  problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, \\\"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\\\" Papa didn't know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home  and told Mamma. Mamma said, \\\"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on.\\\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I  tell Lyuda, \\\"Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see  you out.\\\" Mamma says, \\\"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can  see what the situation in town is.\\\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was  ready. Mamma says, \\\"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\\\" We sat down at the  table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything  out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating. We turned on the television, and the show \\\"In Fairy-Tale Land\\\" was coming on.  We cleared the table.  We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't  see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people  . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's  an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story  buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20  people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see  several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not  killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of  the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their  feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in  general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak . . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he got up and left or not.  I become terrified and go home and say, \\\"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \\\" Then the crowd  runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and  starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors  are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is  shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it  turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and  kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop  them.  They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the  windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,  and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't  crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey  Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear  tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous  din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were  shouting Father's name, \\\"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\\\" or something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma  says, \\\"Into the bedroom, quickly!\\\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part  of our dowry; Mamma says, \\\"Hide there, they probably won't come in there,  they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\\\" She says, \\\"We'll tell them  that we live alone here.\\\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in  the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say  that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I  can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak  Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told  her anything or not.  Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, \\\"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened.\\\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \\\"Get out of the apartment, leave.\\\" I  say, \\\"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the  apartment.\\\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, \\\"There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!\\\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,  commanding them: \\\"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\\\"  And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start  undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,  in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how  much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The  atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among  themselves who would go first.  Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.  He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It  seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, \\\"Well, we're done here.\\\" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs  . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the  window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the  windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking  about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong  person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,  which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they  don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I  humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing  . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.  I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't  know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by  my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,  something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death  come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What  happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.   I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me  clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember  that I said the same words over and over again: \\\"Mamma, what happened, Mamma,  what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\\\" I can't make  sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all  went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his  courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though  he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he  served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor  brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,  \\\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\\\" How do I know who's who  and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when  they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda  said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going  to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's  hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our  sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding  on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in  there. So they survived.  My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back  up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed  there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put  it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and  knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \\\"I'm not going to let you  in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings  and we'll leave the building.\\\" Lyuda says, \\\"I'll stay at your place because of what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\\\" It was just for a  moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came  back to our place and lay under the bed . . .  I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone  number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he  came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were  simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,  it was hard to breathe . . .  My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our  administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary  passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right  after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a  great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not  only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,  without stopping. After us.  I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young  Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.  Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in  Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \\\"Run quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\\\" At that moment  three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,  there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything  out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to  scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you  here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of  the soldiers said, \\\"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the  Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\\\" So at that point the  Daghestan police were there.  When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously  injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they  were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda  and me and said, \\\"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't  know what to do with the rest.\\\"  So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My  boss said, \\\"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens.\\\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She  examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait  ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People  called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.  That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,  \\\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\\\" She looks me over and  says, \\\"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things.\\\" And I think, great, I have to deal  with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this  condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't  have the energy to say, \\\"How could our people possibly be smart enough to  think of something that yours haven't already done?\\\" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her  own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next  morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything  more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,  nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at  them.  I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \\\"Better to ask  your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can  better explain what happened.\\\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw  themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward.  Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me  clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,  but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up  above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \\\"I can't believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\\\" I went back to my  ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and  brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I  couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one  had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .  Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should  be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an  Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must  have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something  else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.  The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,  and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many  troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw  a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought  that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait  after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't  come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.  I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm  me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw  a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each  other and asking, \\\"What happened, what went on?\\\" Two days later they came to  see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed  interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they  could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues  who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,  neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what  happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart  . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,  not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part  of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I  lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be  from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of  insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.  There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took  me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were  emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's  friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.  They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasn't cut.  They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon  appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not  talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \\\"We  demand that Seidov come!\\\" The response was, \\\"It's Seidov who sent us.\\\" Seidov  is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,  \\\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same  things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you  agitators.\\\" And so on. More of them said, \\\"Have Seidov himself come.\\\" This  went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us  out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because  they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The  smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who  had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a  club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay  to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day  someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie  theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it  was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants  took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in  Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to  mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting  right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only  the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women  were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come  any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered  together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie  theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to  the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and  couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently  they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my  eyes.  Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \\\"Aren't you an  Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\\\" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in  nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs.  So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't  spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered  the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only  the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,  she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the  building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.  This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were  already in the city.  They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire  families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't  see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult  now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify  the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard  that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,  including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3.  They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who  had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were  going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply  savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did  what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that  hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from  the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the  ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and  she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and  beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that  whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and  carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.  I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of  people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a  song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has  that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,  the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They  couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldn't remember anyone's face.  I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had  talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the  Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met  with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint  meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of  those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.  They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were  dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch  me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these  people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan.  The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was  there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't  recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, \\\"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\\\" He turned away  and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina  anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out  anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became  myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people  there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his  name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one  we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \\\"If he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his  alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not  responsible for my words.\\\" He said, \\\"What did they do to you, how awful,  myself, I hid an Armenian family.\\\" Then after some time goes by he comes back  again and says something entirely different: \\\"I wasn't at home, my family and  I went to Baku.\\\" I said, \\\"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before.\\\" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is  being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me  that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.  What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the  head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an  insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the  same time  I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I can't say.                                                       When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,  because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it  always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my  face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,  they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,  is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ  dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our  building was killed, it was that man.  A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come  over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was  all over, people started making announcements in town saying that  investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now  they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he  himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy  came to the plant and said, \\\"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the  bus station on Saturday at ten.\\\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do  you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,  probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,  because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had  killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of  that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that  the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from  I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word  I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an  Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.  His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from  Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.  His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani  KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many  photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at  curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,  the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a  haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he  is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,  I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.  At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,  all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, \\\"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like  you.\\\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything  without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when  she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had  all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.  They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that  moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the  faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the  apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and  no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have  anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the  apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the  apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they  know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the  building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis  lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our  apartment.  I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt  when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from  our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \\\"Karina, we  saw all of it, how could it happen?\\\" They're asking me! Well I just don't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to  me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been  able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani  woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated  woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two  Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She  came down to the entryway and said, \\\"You'll come in this entryway over my dead body.\\\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some  folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't  even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They  couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani  stopped them.  They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place  they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the  apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?  Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is  some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed  to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had  come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They  screamed and screamed: \\\"Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!\\\"  Only they didn't shout \\\"kill,\\\" they shouted \\\"gurun ermianlary.\\\" Gurun  literally means \\\"kill,\\\" or \\\"destroy.\\\"  That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their  kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part  of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . .  A boy said to my mother \\\"Where's the gold?\\\" Mamma said he must have been 12  to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the  Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the  fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where  the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a  little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to  wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were  bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and  Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,  bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had  shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and  tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having  trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and  started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted  to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by  accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,  \\\"What's happened?\\\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \\\"At least go and  find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or  murdered them, at least bring the corpses.\\\" He went looking for us. At that  moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that  someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out  from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought  she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to  herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from  under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that  way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled  down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it happened in.  And Mamma said, \\\"Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting  something or other, and running toward the other building.\\\" It had more or  less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I  tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \\\"Listen; let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how  long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything.\\\" I don't get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe  not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \\\"Mamma, what do you need any of that  for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\\\" She says, \\\"No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the  night at someone else's.\\\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were  coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He  shouts, \\\"Come back, they're coming!\\\" They didn't have enough time to get a  lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my  knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his  wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to  leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,  they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,  maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished  building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more  or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.  Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,  something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even  live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and  mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.  They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \\\"My  God, what is going on around here? When will this end?\\\" We turned off the  lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who  knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but  they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that  he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his  apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up  at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, \\\"Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of us.\\\" He went upstairs, and they say, \\\"Aren't you taking anything from this  apartment?\\\" He says, \\\"I don't need anything.\\\" And the women who were standing  in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were  standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the  first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time  to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty  pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really  mad, and he says, \\\"Where's the rug? I just put it right here!\\\" They tell him,  \\\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\\\" He ran off in that direction.  Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,  there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They  just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,  she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told  me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,  the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \\\"Where's the girl who was here?\\\" And he became furious. The woman tells him, \\\"She came to . . . \\\" She didn't know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \\\"She came to and went to the basement.\\\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the  whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took  flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been  standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there  to get me. Then one of them said, \\\"There's so much water down there, she  probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in  the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\\\" I didn't know that, and  when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't  just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .  After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really  didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and  started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.  Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people  who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think  that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but  they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole  brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\\\" That's  all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not  one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were  standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women  that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for  one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,  an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:  if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed  to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \\\"If you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\\\" So she left. That trick didn't work on them.  Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget  that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,  then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.  And no one did anything. Anything.

I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply.  Sherlette   P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  \\\"It doesn't matter what color His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts.\\\"  This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for saying that \\\"it doesn't matter...\\\"  to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT MATTERS.\",\" So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)   You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people  have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.  And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you  can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the  FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.   I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense. You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this  compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless  to me.  I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't  stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me  sad and sick.   Have you ever heard of Jonestown? The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority  worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these  people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot  more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as  last year.   By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.   BTW, I thought the second ammendment was God.  :-)   \",\"Try the folks at Dimolex Corp., La Crescenta, CA 91214. Their number is (818) 957-7001.

What is important is HOW they are used, and what            else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )             (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                 1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind            at a time, preferably grapes.                 2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half            raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape            clean the intestinal linings.                 3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice            you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune            juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from            concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.

HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered,  the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental  authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.  In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?   XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?    It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \\\"yes\\\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop:    void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)  {   int             answer;   answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Really Quit?\\\");   if (RET_YES == answer)    {    answer = AskUser(w, \\\"Are You Really Positive?\\\");    if (RET_YES == answer)     exit(0);                 }  }   A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it.  This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \\\"OK\\\", \\\"Cancel\\\" and  \\\"Help\\\" or equivalents:    int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;   /* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }   The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user  finally selects one of those choices:    void response(w, client, call)         Widget          w;         XtPointer client;         XtPointer call;   {   int *answer = (int *) client;   XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;         switch (reason->reason) {         case XmCR_OK:                 *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */                 break;         case XmCR_CANCEL:                 *answer = RET_NO;    break;         case XmCR_HELP:                 *answer = RET_HELP;                 break;         default:                 return;         } }  and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there.

If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do  what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures  and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.   #include <X11/CoreP.h>  #include <X11/Xresource.h>  String XtName (widget)  Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */  {  return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);  }  [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program:    The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the  realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (\\\"no window\\\") could  create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget()  before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.   Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call,  but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also  wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?  The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of  the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error:  1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which aren't good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:    display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);  if (display)   { do X stuff }  else   { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case  XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].  This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128)  How do I make a \\\"busy cursor\\\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?   The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute \\\"toplevel\\\" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which  continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its  children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X  connection to the display.   What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,    close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.  Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?   No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical  sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions.  You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.   Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly  Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131)  What are these \\\"Xlib sequence lost\\\" errors?   You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?   It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor.  A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.  Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.  Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new data:       if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event.   If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.  Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.  [courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?    You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the  window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will  generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code  would appear after window was created and mapped:   while (!done)     {       XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);       switch (the_event.type) {  case Expose:  /* On expose events, redraw */   XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);   break;  ...  }     }   Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't  set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background  colors, so this program could previously include this code:   ...   the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */   the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                 GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);   ...   Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is  black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for  foreground and background.  And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?   The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A  server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available  Screens on this particular Display connection.  The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.  In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.  (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \\\"Display\\\" in the names --  XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

GNU SmallTalk has a beta native SmallTalk binding to X called STIX (by Steven.Byrne@Eng.Sun.COM). It is still in its beginning stages, and  documentation is sparse outside the SmallTalk code itself. The sources are  available as /pub/gnu/smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) or  ugle.unit.no (129.241.1.97).  Prolog bindings (called \\\"XWIP\\\") written by Ted Kim at UCLA while supported in part by DARPA are available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwip.tar.Z or ftp.cs.ucla.edu:pub/xwip.tar.Z. These prolog language bindings depend on having a Quintus-type foreign function interface in your prolog. The developer has gotten it to work with Quintus and  SICStus prolog. Inquiries should go to xwip@cs.ucla.edu. [3/90]  Scheme bindings to Xlib, OSF/Motif, and Xaw are part of the Elk distribution; version 1.5a on export obsoletes the version on the R5 contrib tape.   x-scm, a bolt-on accessory for Aubrey Jaffer's \\\"scm\\\" Scheme interpreter that provides an interface to Xlib, Motif, and OpenLook, is now available via  FTP from altdorf.ai.mit.edu:archive/scm/xscm1.05.tar.Z and  nexus.yorku.ca:pub/scheme/new/xscm1.05.tar.Z.   Ada bindings to Motif, explicitly, will eventually be made available by the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, probably through the normal electronic means.  Advance information can be obtained from dsouleles@dsfvax.jpl.nasa.gov, who may respond as time permits.  AdaMotif is a complete binding to X and Motif for the Ada language, for many common systems; it is based in part upon the SAIC/Unisys bindings and also includes a UIL to Ada translator.

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be  re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]   Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the  original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.  [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?    A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices:  - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers  support the extension.  - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note  that there is no X notion of a \\\"transparent color index\\\".  - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.  - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.]  If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values.  If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.

I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesn't work.    XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.  [1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage?    The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.   Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?   Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].  The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.  [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]  Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.   Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function Name: GetVRoot  * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root  * Arguments: the display and the screen  * Returns: the root window for the client  */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \\\"__SWM_VROOT\\\", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {  Atom            actual_type;  int             actual_format;  long            nitems, bytesafter;  Window         *newRoot = NULL;   if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,      False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {    root = *newRoot;    break;   }  }   return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h  functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?   Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?   It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.    The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).  [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?   There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?   Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking.  There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.  Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?    Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries.  Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \\\"by  hand\\\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more specifically:  1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.  2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).  3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.  4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where    a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)   b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)  5) render I2  Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.  The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer.  In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

(How do I reserve names?)   There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names.

This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:  He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.  I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote out of context.    I asked Jim the following:  Jim replied by saying   But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject \\\"Silence is concurrence\\\":     Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.  Does \\\"silence is concurrence\\\" imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.   But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next  gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion. Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help make it more clear, Jim), titled \\\"Inductive Logic\\\":   More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \\\"axed\\\" his articles, but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ... Well, I can't see where he is going with this.  But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80 articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)
