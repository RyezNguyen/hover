For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to contain blanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actually performed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually made clear in the below definition).   What do you mean by \\\"reasonable?\\\"  [...]  Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But, even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning can still be deduced.   [math lesson deleted]  Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstanding feud between two families which claim that the other committed some travesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your \\\"problem,\\\" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested \\\"murderer\\\" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?  See, in a totally objective system where all the information is available, such a nested definition isn't really a problem.\",\"  For the last time, Bobby.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers  To: National Desk, Defense Writer  Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of           the United States, 202-479-2258     WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.    In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior service personnel.    ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.), suggested \\\"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.\\\"    He asked the commission \\\"to remove from consideration all locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to warrant approval of the requested action.\\\"    \\\"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve installations on this list are large enough to have a significant impact on the community, if closed,\\\" wrote Hultman.  \\\"The major issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large percentage of the existing locations.\\\"    Hultman reminded the commission, \\\"The fact that the vast majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this process certainly supports the thesis\\\" that these actions are simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve.    ROA also noted \\\"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480 Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\\\"    Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind., Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.    A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El Toro, Calif., plus six others.  -30-\",\"/ hpcc01:rec.motorcycles / cookson@mbunix.mitre.org (Cookson) /  2:02 pm  Apr  2, 1993 /  All right people, this inane bug wibbling is just getting to much.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like '89).   On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.  Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching staff looks pretty good.

Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of  which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).  Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)  Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.  Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?  I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.  Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ? I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.  Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?\",\"Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of like the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything except your elbow.\",\"A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp.  \\\"agrep 2.0.4\\\" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool  source code project available from:  cs.arizona.edu   in directory \\\"agrep\\\"  agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to specify the \\\"similarity\\\" of matches in the data.  For example say you make up a password/phrase of \\\"qimwe7l\\\". Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some \\\"crack\\\" program to brute-force search for it?  You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none, one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But   agrep -3 \\\"qimwe7l\\\" bigwordandphraselist  finds that the pattern \\\"qimwe7l\\\" is too close to the pattern \\\"imsel\\\" (part of \\\"himself\\\" and a host of others), to be of any cryptographic value as a key.  An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like \\\"teh\\\" for \\\"the\\\".  A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password. (In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)   And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o' typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example, say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book \\\"Neuromancer\\\" in the huge SF-Lover's archives. Even with an error distance specification as small as of \\\"1\\\" I will find all those people who think the title was \\\"Necromancer\\\" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?  Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.  You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.  You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency, National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.  You can also specify \\\"fixed\\\" areas: looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct, you might say:  agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase  will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors (addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can also \\\"weight\\\" the relative \\\"cost\\\" for substiutions, additions, or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination, you might know that some kinds of damage cause the \\\"A\\\" nucelotide to drop out more than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the \\\"deletion cost\\\" to count as \\\"c\\\" errors.  A steganographic use (I even used \\\"agrep -2 \\\"<steg>eograp\\\" E\\\" just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...  Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the \\\"hits\\\" into a useful form.  For example,  agrep -d \\\"^From\\\" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'  says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase', 'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.  And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.  As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do an anonymous FTP.  Get this now. It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

It -> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for -> maintaining a milita.  -> a free state.  Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun  militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how \\\"well regulated\\\"  modifies \\\"militia\\\" is:  to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, \\\"wet\\\"  modifes \\\"day\\\" in the phrase \\\"a wet day.\\\"  The amendment is similiar to the statement:  A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep  and wear boots, shall not be infringed. So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar, what does the \\\"unorganized militia\\\" have to due with the right to own guns?  -> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn't restrict the right, or -> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other -> than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a -> right of the people.

No not, unconditional, but \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".  Infringed is defined as:  To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath,   an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.  To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach. This definition implies the following of some form of existing  agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries  or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word  \\\"unconditional\\\" implies no agreements or all previous agreements  are off, which is the opposite.  The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e., \\\"congress shall make no law,\\\" are much stronger.  They clearly            ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply \\\"unconditional.\\\"  If the writers of the amendment, wanted  unconditional whay didn't they says, \\\"congress shall make no  laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\\"? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped the people from forming a \\\"well regutaled militia.\\\"  The duties of a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" to the government are descussed in  Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II  Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution. \",\" I have a hard time understanding this attitude.  If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.  As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.    The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke about it anyway, just to scare people.

But there's an even better way out of this. PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.

The only thing that has happened is that  the two sides have exchanged roles.  The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California, it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.

I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.  According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under the \\\"War on Drugs\\\" campaign of \\\"zero tolerance\\\" due process protections have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only legal, but political:  \\\"My fellow Americans, we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder\\\"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws.

In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.       They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.\",\"Does anyone know where I can still get an internal fax modem for the  original mac portable?

Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (I hope)?  Has this happened to anyone else? Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?  Thanks, Tom\",\"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.  I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. The compressor is about 2\\\" in diameter and about 5\\\" long.  The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it.  I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.  The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).  If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them first.  How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).  I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.\",\"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----        >So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front    >ends.

The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade).

Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope  since my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000  are all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and at  least 50MHz (maybe 100...)   During my shopping at hamfests etc. I've run into the   problem of \\\"old scope\\\" terminology. I can imagine what  a \\\"mainframe\\\" and \\\"plug-in\\\" are but some things like  the above \\\"storage\\\", \\\"coax input\\\" (Hey, where do I get a   probe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week   before I got anything resembling \\\"a good trace\\\" - they all  come with BNC connectors!), \\\"unblanking\\\" (huh?), and, oh,  just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along the  way to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model   numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than  others - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of the  higher SN the better apply?   Take care.\",\"Hmmm... I hadn't heard about rockets. ATF must be escalating their tall tails... anyway  Why should they have \\\"done something\\\"? The Davidians had not attacked or even threatened anyone.   It is not yours nor the governments right to tell others what they have a legitimate right to own.   Is child abuse now within the jurisdiction of the department of the treasury? Attacking citizens without due process on the strength of unsubstantiated rumors about a violation of a law which does not fall under your jurisdiction is a pretty serious breech of rights.   If he gets any more done we will really be in trouble!\",\"Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com     Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the \\\"church choosing process\\\". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and \\\"leave yourself on a few doorsteps\\\" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base.\",\"An earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to WinQVT/Net version 3.4.

The display is bearly readable but all the details are seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one in yellow and a ghost image in red.  The background is also a little greenish.  I read some time ago, before I ever thought I would hook my mac up to a VGA screen, about an incompatability with some VGA monitors due to the sync on green signal.  Does this sound like it could be the same demon?  I also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem.  I don't the details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them?  I checked all the FAQ's for this and didn't find anything about it.  Did I miss it somewhere?

The whole ride back I felt sluggish.  I was certainly much more alert on the ride in.  I'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.  From now on, a little snack will do.  I'd much rather have a get that full/sluggish feeling closer to home.  -Paul\",\"I want to start of list for Syclone and Typhoon owners.

Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as  manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that work on Devguide is continuing apace.  We had quite a strong show of interest from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference. Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current customers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.

There is virtual certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset control's zero detent position.  2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may also find that loading the output of the function generator also reduces the harmonic distortion.  Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:  ------10K--------+---------? ohm ----                  | Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T. (loaded)         | -----------------+-------------------  Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the millivolt test generator you want.  Good luck,  \",\"   Bobby, there's a question here that I just HAVE to ask. If all of your posts aren't some sort of extended, elaborate hoax, why are you trying so hard to convince the entire civilised world that you're feeble minded?

NHL teams can't afford to import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build their teams around local players.  I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several \\\"crucial\\\" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way American/Canadian fans do. Call it \\\"the Minnesota North Stars\\\" effect: Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.

A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer      uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause.\",\"Hi from Australia,  I am a car enthusiast in Australia.

You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX) should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.   There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses. Your file should look like this:  137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver> 137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>   Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.   Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also, but  apparently they don't.   Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address.  It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.  Hope it helps, Richard \",\" The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds. There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.  I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc. Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism). More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body, the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.  There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind. Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.  There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John the Baptist,     \\\"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\\\"  This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\\\"If you care to accept it\\\").  So I took care to point out, not that the Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I pointedly used \\\"repeated earth lives\\\" to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word \\\"reincarnation\\\". The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely free from eastern tradition.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \\\"dirty\\\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \\\"This is WA1QT\\\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.      \",\" I tell you, Steve Stone is like a prophet.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"  I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.   Source: Edward K. Boghosian, \\\"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting,\\\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.  ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties, including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the  Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.  The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA...  Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement  was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam  Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued  support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,  pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be  open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.  Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that  his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue. \\\"The doors of our camps are always open to  Armenian freedom fighters,\\\" he affirmed.  Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations, a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.  More than significant was the large number of messages received by the  organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.                   SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM  Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to \\\"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\\\" to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \\\"Bureau.\\\" The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement, open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.  The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence. The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

No need to use the same book size and the same letter   charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!    The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year  first published..

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller circuitry present on NuBus Macs.  Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted, there are more NuBus cards.

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin   Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking    (205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.  Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\",\"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]  Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"I hear Daigle will eb the first pick next year. What is the word on Kariya??? Anybody ever seen him play on TV????

Why are so you worried about high school kids \\\"getting their kicks\\\" with scanners, as compared to what the feds can do, and have done, to their targets?  \\\"Better than the status quo\\\" isn't good enough, I'd say.

Well, as John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real \\\"secret\\\" left around here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself, nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \\\"weenie mailers\\\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head.  ***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************  Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!) days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).  ***********************************************************************  One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya? The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, & e-mail address. For example:  0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM  (PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)  Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------              \\\"Denizens of Doom\\\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)        [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]  There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal  things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and   motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,   helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy,  traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double  entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They  argue with each other and plan rides together.  The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that,  although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each  other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world  and communicate with each other electronically via computer.  The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;   the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry  professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently,  rec.motorcycles (pronounced \\\"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\\\" it's the file name for  the group's primary on-line \\\"meeting place\\\") carries about 2250 articles per  month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent  posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred  to as the DoD.  The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of  parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer  enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \\\"Denizen  of Doom.\\\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of  the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of  course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.  The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules  appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the  List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been  almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and  Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany, Norway and Finland.  Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run  of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the  American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser --  selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a  few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were  donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500  to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs  in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.  As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go  riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of  DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's  \\\"Silicon Valley.\\\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on  Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California  \\\"Joust.\\\"  The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big  barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern  California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north,  meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan  for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction  with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.  Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective  communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional  motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in  search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to  get together.  Long may they flame.   \\\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\\\" [centerbar]  This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which  you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do  anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \\\"flames\\\";   issuing them is called \\\"flaming.\\\"  Flames often start when a member  disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A  typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be  something like:  \\\"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad  poseur!\\\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense  of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding  ability and your cat.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------            _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                    by John Sloan  DoD #0011  Periodically the question \\\"What is DoD?\\\" is raised. This is one of those questions in the same class as \\\"Why is the sky blue?\\\", \\\"If there is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\\\" and \\\"Why do women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they dump you?\\\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition, and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the halls of academe for generations.   A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and signed it \\\"The Denizen of Doom\\\". Not wishing to identify himself, he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed.   He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership number.   Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members.   In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by #11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and distributed on VHS by #18)!   Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races, placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell.   The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which includes name, state, and email address.   The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name).

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent (the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against you. Read 'em and weep.   We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection:   Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!!   Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW      crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer      11 but what the heck.    Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.  Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at      least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!      Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a      Woosh-a-stream.  Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.  Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???  Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see      what they say, eh?   Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.  High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.  Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!  Terrible: B.T.???  Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.  Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.  Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway???   Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.  Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.  Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.  Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!  Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???  Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean       even Villy Ogle flamed me for that!   Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.  Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush!   Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?  Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?  Heritick: Nahhh.  Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.  Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?  Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!  Muck: What's a carbujector?  Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!  Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!  Dill: Well, where do we race?  Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't      ride!   Muck: No! No! Quiet!  Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.      They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!  High: My 9 too!  Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!  Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!  Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin!   Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like      I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting      it up on the ole ventral stand!    Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and      Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too!   Booster: I hate Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.  Booster: I love Cavortin.  All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.  Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?  Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.  Muck: What about a Tridump?  Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?  Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?  Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?  Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.  Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter. Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.  Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.  And Now even more west coasters pour in. Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!  Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!  Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth: Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.  Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.  More riders from the west coast come into the discussion: Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.  Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.  With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn.  Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns.   Muck: Why??  Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.  Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.  Clean: No GOOD!  Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!  Clean: Inferior!  Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a thrill...   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for?   Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,      WILHEM!   Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW?   And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all boomed out. G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding      Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions.   All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.  Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the next gut wretching episode of \\\"The Yearning and Riderless\\\" with its ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the question of: \\\"To Helmet or Not to Helmet\\\" will be aired, this is heady material and viewer discretion is advised.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------            Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video                  by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94   [Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat, with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.]   (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as \\\"Chuck\\\". I guess you had to be there. I wasn't.)   Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,  cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,  may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted  to live a man's life, [Music slowly builds in background]  riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes  and the deepest valleys,  living the life of a Motorcyclist;  doing donuts and evading the police;  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;  eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,   I Want to be      A Denizen!  [Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines, showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat Boy.]   Chuck [Sings to the tune of \\\"The Lumberjack Song\\\"]:  I'm a Denizen and I'm okay, I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]: He's a Denizen and he's okay, He flames all night and he rides all day.  I ride my bike; I eat my lunch; I go to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays I ride Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus]: He rides his bike; He eats his lunch; He goes to the lavat'ry. On Wednesdays he rides Skyline, Running children down with glee.  [Chorus refrain]: 'Cause He's a Denizen...  I ride real fast, My name is Chuck, It somehow seems to fit. I over-rate the worst bad f*ck, But like a real good sh*t.  Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay! I flame all night and I ride all day.  [Chorus refrain]: Oh, He's a Denizen...  I wear high heels And bright pink shorts,  full leathers and a bra. I wish I rode a Harley,  just like my dear mama.  [Chorus refrain]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                      Why you have to be killed.  Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.  Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \\\"What does DoD stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?\\\" Naturally, a Denizen who had watched the movie \\\"Top Gun\\\" a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied:  \\\"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you.\\\"  And the rest is history.  A variation on the \\\"security\\\" theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where known) include:  Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)  Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)  Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver   Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts   Dumpers of Dirtbikes  Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                       The rec.moto.photo archive  First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made, and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.  Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages, the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.  Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive.  **********************************************************  Via ftp:  cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]  Via e-mail:  The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:  dir [dod] send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif send [dod]dodframe.ps  and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.  Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of 50K each; not a good idea. --  Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner  **********************************************************  A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful? Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours (California time).   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        Patches? What patches?  You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins. And your reaction was probably: \\\"I want!\\\", or \\\"That's sick!\\\", or perhaps \\\"That's sick! I want!\\\"  Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't because of any \\\"exclusivity\\\" attempt, but simply because there is no \\\"DoD store\\\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is someone says \\\"I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\\\" Then orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all this is anarchy in action.  Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99), motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts (DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by popular demand].  All \\\"profits\\\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum, you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of \\\"Denizens of Doom, USENET, The World\\\", complete with a DoD pin.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.  ~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles ~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> ~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum ~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT  I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum, the other day.  \\\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:  Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to  see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.

Rides:  Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]  Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up, riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes.  And though it's not an \\\"official\\\" (as if anything could be official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah. European Denizens have staged some gathers too.

It has a certain appeal on its own  josh \",\"  I hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify some things so I won't get flamed.  First of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a ``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to repeat this every time.  I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group'' property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have thought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means nothing at all.  Then I wrote,   What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people would simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit from better technology in the same way.  Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun. \",\" Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me  as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people group he was serving. WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture in minority languages.  The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this along the lines of \\\"ideological manipulation and cultural interference\\\" is probably no more than Christianising and education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.  I think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a legitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the gospel among underdeveloped people.\",\"   Must there be a \\\"why\\\" to this?  I ask because of what you also      assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no \\\"why\\\"      to His existence.  So the question is reversed, \\\"Why can't      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to      \\\"just exist\\\"?  Why must there be a \\\"why\\\" to the universe?\\\"   It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also      create man.  Now, I don't see this happening in my lifetime,      nor do I assert it is probable.  But the possibility is there,      given scientists are working hard at \\\"decoding\\\" out \\\"genetic      code\\\" to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation.      Again, though, must there be \\\"why\\\" or a \\\"divine prupose\\\" to      man's existence?   As far as we can tell, man falls into the \\\"mammal\\\" catagory.  Now,      if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then      we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man      is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're      warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in      genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.    Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.    Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome! \",\" Nothing is perfect. Nothing is perpetual. i.e. even if it is perfect, it isn't going to stay that way forever.

JLS\",\"I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)          Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and here's what he told me:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is what is included:         - TCD-D3 DATman.         - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8\\\" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for           analog output.         - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).         - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The           unit is still under factory warrantee.         - AC adaptor/battery charger.         - Rechargable battery.  I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).  [By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an  extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about  $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5  years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice. Send him mail and ask him what he wants.          Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy for their recent live album.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------          'nuff said.          The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are available if you absolutely must have one.          Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.

This means that the CPU doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS just sits and waits anyway.   Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is* ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.  This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.

Steve []\",\"In <Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu>   [ . . . ]  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"Does anybody have any solid data on how many legally owned versus illegally owned firearms are used in crime.

WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE \\\"SPINOFFS\\\" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\\\" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with \\\"SCHWARZENEGGER\\\" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night). Is NASA really supporting this junk? Are protesting groups being organized in the States? Really, really depressed.

This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's  treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying \\\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\\"  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

For if they  escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much   more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that   speaks from heaven:   Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised,  saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also  heaven.   And this word, Yet once more, signifies the removing of  those things that are shaken, as of things that are made,  that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.   Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,   let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably   with reverence and godly fear:   For our God is a consuming fire.

Kinda gives Flaming a whole new meaning, I reckon.            - < > -  The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming of the Lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are unprepared can't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to  guilt. Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as  we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh  as a reminder.   Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't  have a good idea yet what \\\"being shielded by the seals\\\" actually involves  or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical well versed.)         - < > -  Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so  if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way.

Not worth fearing or  worrying about though, not before:        -* The Greater Glory of GOD *-     Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to  see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible I've taken in  studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re- warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which  is not yet clear.   Much much more important is \\\"Charity\\\" -- which by definition *is* --                      Love for GOD  (I hope Dear Reader, you've taken all this as an expression of faith,   and not a statement of mere fact. Seems many folks get real upset at   reminders. ;-)\",\"  While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I  have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just  friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.  \",\" I could never find the Microsoft mouse driver on my Windows 3.1 installation disks, but DOS 6.0 also has version 8.20 of MOUSE.COM.   ---\",\"        Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be imported?

But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I've found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only \\\"real solution\\\" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to have any more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the \\\"internal nerves\\\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that \\\"force\\\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\",\"Before getting excited and implying that I am posting fabrications, I would suggest the readers to consult the newspaper in question.

In 1943, this battalion  had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro  (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5  million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council  was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was  recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily  formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the  principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the  Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination  of the Jews.

Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.  In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium is a bitch to play.

The Amendment does nor refer to \\\"well organized\\\", it says \\\"well regulated\\\".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how _well regulated_ I am.     Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that was to insure the People could form a \\\"well regulated Militia\\\", not a \\\"well organized militia\\\".

James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General     Welfare\\\" clause): \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first     to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a     recital of particulars.\\\"  But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He only wrote it.   That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist Papers.    Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says \\\"well organized militia\\\".

The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written with something else in mind and \\\"propoganda\\\" put out by its supporters.         But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?         Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really* means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.          If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why on earth did you make a point of calling them \\\"propogranda?\\\"  That would seem to be irrelevent.          Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.          Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)           In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have had less power?           Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although badly) to the U.S. President.          Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is \\\"in principle\\\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate) but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in?         Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to \\\"attack\\\" which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want.  With national \\\"interest groups\\\" it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less  \\\"contributions\\\" to make.          Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance, medicine, and most other questions.        Local government has not \\\"failed\\\" in that it hasn't done what it should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout, only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower.        I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime?        The more people want the more Congress will take power to \\\"sell\\\" it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \\\"special interests\\\" is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.          Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness.          Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \\\"pork\\\" in that state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.         The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \\\"buy off\\\" states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.          But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself  that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem is significantly reduced.          The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing.          The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different areas, different solutions may be called for.         And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents.         I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt.            Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this. Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them, I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution, which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House.          The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)          To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse.          *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of which was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's anything resembling a record.          Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to got through something more than a bare majority          Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.          Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good* argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.          No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action. \",\"VESA local bus motherboard, 4MB RAM, 64K cache, 1.2 & 1.44 Floppy, 130 MB Hard Drive, IDE controller (2HD&2FD) 2S/1P/1G Local Bus 1MB SVGA Video Card, 14\\\" SVGA Monitor (.28dpi) Mini Tower, 101-key Keyboard\",\"We have a Sun CD-ROM drive which I would like to play audio CD's in.

Unlike  bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative.   On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is  because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top. If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people  for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had  conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did.  The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done (ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the present generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do  any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds, even thousands, of years ago.   My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change them. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle anything anyway.   That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because they are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and after high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make you right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only a couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not to yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear (ie. a Winner).   If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions. And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through the grace of God.   To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the very name Christian.

White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.  \\\"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot  see?\\\"  What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it again.

If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus Christ then they are NOT Christian.

They include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.   When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948, the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan, who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their latrines.   Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to control the city.   Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca, where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles.  \",\"In PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 \\\"Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches.\\\" note what it does NOT site as a factor: PRICE. int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI {from the article it seems you get plug and play SCSI-1 only since SCSI-2 in FULL implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices.} SCSI-1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play program. \",\"                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Wow!

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to education, to establish a family and have children, to human dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are more important to human existence that the rights of states.  2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.  3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an unresolved conflict exists.  4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples and nations.  5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.  6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed.  7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.  8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice. When people love, they share.  Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.  1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab.  2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner, although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.  3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.   4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of governments and international organizations.  5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner.  Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will attempt to identify some of these:  1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However, it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation.  2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights (see above)  3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see above)  4.      It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes.  5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than $3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.  I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment.\",\"There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.  This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes happens that someone says \\\"My grandson is the cutest baby!\\\" and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says \\\"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\\\"  This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people, nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me, it is not.   Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from John E King:   No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say \\\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that.\\\"  You would read \\\"I will make you a bare rock\\\" and \\\"You will never be rebuilt\\\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.  In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal reading, they could read this passage and conclude \\\"medium-size city\\\".  You seem to feel that \\\"Never be rebuilt\\\" means \\\"be rebuilt\\\" -- maybe so, but it is hardly a `clear implication'.     Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but it's at least a two-horse town.  But supposing 22,000 people is a \\\"small town\\\" -- it's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted.   And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying \\\"he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.\\\"  Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26. Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.  Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.   *  This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.  For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some \\\"clear implications\\\" out of hat.  When Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your towers\\\", that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \\\"demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\\\", that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would \\\"build a ramp up to your walls\\\", that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls.  See?  A few \\\"clear implications\\\" that are totally contrary to the text, and you can reconcile anything you want. \",\"Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.\",\" Those areas became states.  Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.

The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, \\\"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.\\\"  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of \\\"overpopulation,\\\" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, \\\"because it involves too much study and effort.\\\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a \\\"traditional\\\" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary\",\" Probably would not be fatal in an adult at that dose, but could kill a child.

Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and voice exemplars, and to take blood and DNA tests.   No, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it happens, evidence that will convict you is stored.   The crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn over the key.  The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to  be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. In the example I gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).  Moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you.

The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.

The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.

Everything seems to work fine except for the Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup, and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).  One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have \\\"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.\\\"  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.

This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system.

However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the \\\"super-apostles\\\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.

The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, \\\"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.\\\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an  analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  \",\"    If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. But this is not the issue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.

Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.

And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.  The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution.  Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington) on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites.  Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see, \\\"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\\\" Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.  They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the \\\"fern field\\\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be \\\"shot in the back.\\\"  As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.  At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \\\"fend him off with his gun.\\\"  [It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \\\"Stop!  U.S. Marshal!\\\"  Harris then \\\"...brought the weapon around at hip level and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\\\"  Cooper fired at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots, yelled, \\\"You son of a bitch!\\\" and ran toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.  On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, \\\"You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\\\"  Nevin also pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him. Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [no answer was available].  Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.  Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992  Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war  -------------------------------------------  Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in  the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from  Agdam  ------  Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt  roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\\\"  Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they  tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians  were caught in \\\"crossfire\\\".  .......

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

When we die we are released from the arc of time, and able to comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this  life.  From that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge of God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether we were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having lived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That  having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the  resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our fully cognizant souls.

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this.  Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?  Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released  new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other  software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure  you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to  dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to  maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?  From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had  a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding  which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?  Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's  PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does  leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be  nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two  different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given  an identical set of conditions.  Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?  Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of  testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary  source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,  (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,  but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe  uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its  wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.\",\"What has this got to do with comp.windows.x?\",\" And at least 500% more user unfriendly as well! \",\"    > If the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called 'Karla', the next    >one  should be called 'Smiley'.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \\\"real\\\" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \\\"fixing\\\"/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT.\",\"1.

The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of \\\"self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters\\\" is probably well under 250 per year.   Handguns designs have included a \\\"hammer block\\\" since around 1960 or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result, modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or  in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.)    I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders  each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only 2.1% of the murders were killings by \\\"wacko\\\"s, you would be wrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated assaults each year.

While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area. I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many instances.   I suspect that this is because \\\"improvement in the human condition\\\" as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options  The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.  Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will  be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86  is listed below.   X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was  done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).  It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.  There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,  X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you  don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).  X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link  2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:      1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \\\"two        headed\\\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86 supports:  SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2  SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC  SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2  Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1   BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active  BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.   Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,  but anyone should feel free to submit patches.  If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to  xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:   Tseng ET4000  Tseng ET3000  Paradise PVGA1  Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of   the PVGA1, and use its driver)  Genoa GVGA  Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000  ATI 18800, 28800   All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,  with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in  256 color mode.   The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of  video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the  ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome  server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.   It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to  non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To  avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86  1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel  clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are  discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how  these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such  a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with  future XFree86 releases.   If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,  it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the  Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not  work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.  In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond  products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions  of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).  If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.   Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA  video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the  CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It  could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset  on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot  of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested  theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not  working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86  working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?   At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards  like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available  in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).   An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact  <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.   A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>  or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.  7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?   The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the  16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory  contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-  planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each  of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-  buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled  16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code  could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).  But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer  implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,  but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?   Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run  X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.  The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending  on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).  To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will  be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable   lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?   Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22  from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:   export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)   ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)   ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)  (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)   Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information  on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?   Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:   ftp.physics.su.oz.au  - SVR4 binaries    under /XFree86/SVR4   ftp.win.tue.nl   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   ferkel.ucsb.edu   - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/SVR4/XFree86   stasi.bradley.edu  - SVR4 binaries    under /pub/XFree86/SVR4   blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/ISC   ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries    under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86   tsx-11.mit.edu   - Linux binaries    under /pub/linux/packages/X11   agate.berkeley.edu  - 386BSD binaries    under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86   ftp.cs.uwm.edu   - Mach binaries    under /i386   Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may  archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will  contain a README file that describes what files you need to take  from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were  made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories   The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot  (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include  files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.   This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified  via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is  nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed  alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files   The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\\\"Xconfig\\\") on startup.  The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in  the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes   David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known  clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.  The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and  is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is  also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on  export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated  occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the  settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to  David for inclusion in the database.   If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file   with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.  It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use  this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information  to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.   NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and        is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot        clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from        your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The        server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.        You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your        Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up        starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit   If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to  reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is  fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?   First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4  Why won't my xterm run properly?   If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define  CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.  csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'   The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping  problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be  installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.  17. 386BSD   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.   Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey  <Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the  file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:       agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2      grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2  18. Linux   You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc  jump libraries installed.   Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.   If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to  run the server as \\\"X -pn\\\". The default startup configuration assumes  that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files  /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the  -pn argument to X386.   Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major  number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not  owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit  console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but  startx won't.   When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with  a tty, for example \\\"xdm < /dev/console &\\\".   For more detailed information, please read the file README present  with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach   Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?   This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is  fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.  Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library   A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.  The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a  which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),  seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include  <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro  definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are  linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these  functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS   This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the  ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite  the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see  something like   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of   ANSICCOPTIONS=\\\"-ansi\\\"   CCOPTIONS=\\\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\\\"  and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:   ANSICCOPTIONS=  to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death  with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because  CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must  add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

It is not comprehensive, ##but, it is well researched.  I imagine your library has it or can get it ##for you through interlibrary loan. ##    I shall try to get hold of it (when I have time to read of course :-)  ##In short, Dr Baucaille began investigating the Bible because of pre- ##ceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  He assumed that ##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by- ##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic. ##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse. ##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems. ##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob- ##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had ##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he ##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable ##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but, ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he ##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to ##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after ##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by ##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that, ##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to ##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the ##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored ##it)?   ##      So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from science.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into your mouth either).      But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can not make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.     Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to be scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making such wild claims.  --- Vinayak -------------------------------------------------------                                            vinayak dutt                                    e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu               standard disclaimers apply\",\" Philip, I think your ideas are well taken and constructive.

That would make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange, the \\\"official\\\" chips would only work with other \\\"official\\\" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes \\\"physically identical clone versions\\\" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary.  Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK --- since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal. Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one \\\"secret\\\" 80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security. Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true with a secret algorithm.

Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it.   It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of  their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the  goaltender, or whatever.

You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me.

BTW, your welcome. -- \",\"  My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn:   Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.   Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.   You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...   Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.   I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

I think this is a big leap sex->depression.

This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?       First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"ha... all this talk about changing the clock speed of the q700 makes me ask??  if i replaced the 8mhz 68000 in my plus with a 16mhz 68000 with a 16mhz clock occilater of its own( not shared by the rest of the mac... just the new 16mhz68000)  would my mac work..... and if it would work.. would you think there where be any problems with sound, vidio,scsi........  it seems like a simple solution to keepa dead slow mechine a live a little longer..

You may find it relevant.  A listmember asks:   > What makes common-law marriages wrong?  A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the West) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.  HOWEVER!  The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part.        The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made.  Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together.

My...\\\" man is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. You mustn't take them literally.  And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record.       The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa.       The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom.       Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't want their daughters seduced and abandoned.       Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just \\\"poetry.\\\"       And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.        Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when Christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you intended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether \\\"You are my main squeeze\\\" and \\\"I am here for the long haul\\\" do in fact cover the same territory as \\\"forsaking all others\\\" and \\\"till death do us part.\\\"        This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic that hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \\\"If a couple love each other and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of God?\\\" Eventually someone asked, \\\"In that case, what is their status if they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk of that!\\\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, \\\"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other,\\\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother.  At this point someone may say, \\\"None of this applies to me and my mate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\\\"      To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.  Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks: At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I answer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?\",\"  Nobody ever exposed your crimes like that before? What was your personal  role in the murder of Orhan Gunduz and Kemal Arikan, again? How many more Muslims will be slaughtered by 'SDPA.ORG' as publicly declared and filed with legal authorities? Please spell it out for us.    \\\"...that more people have to die...\\\"                       SDPA <91@urartu.UUCP>    \\\"Yes, I stated this and stand by it.\\\"                      SDPA <255@urartu.UUCP>        January 28, 1982 - Los Angeles  Kemal Arikan is slaughtered by two Armenians while driving to work.        March 22, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts  Prelude to grisly murder. A gift and import shop belonging to  Orhan Gunduz is blown up. Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either          he gives up his honorary position or he will be \\\"executed\\\". He          refuses. \\\"Responsibility\\\" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.       May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts  Orhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow   to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of   \\\"honorary consul\\\". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.  President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-  witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He   survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting \\\"triumphs\\\" in   the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder   brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer   within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing   in self-satisfaction.   Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak?       December 17, 1980 - Sydney  Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin          Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.  It is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist  organization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), Hagop Hagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist  group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the  children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish and Kurdish people.   THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA      01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in Istanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6 million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad...   Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation) to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins, Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter innocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role  in this scheme?  Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration,  indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with  those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine  barracks in Beirut. You won't be able to get away with your crimes  forever; the justice is long overdue.

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.   Contents:  * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?   * What groups are around? What's a FAQ? Who am I? Why am I here?    Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks. Always   make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it.   You'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same   newsgroup. After a month you'll have a much better sense of what the   readers want to see.  * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt?    No. In fact some newsgroups (notably misc.legal.computing) were   created exactly so that political questions like ``Should RSA be   patented?'' don't get in the way of technical discussions. Many   sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing, comp.org.eff.talk,   comp.patents, sci.math, comp.compression, et al.; for the benefit of   people who don't care about those other topics, try to put your   postings in the right group.    Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic   ``spy stuff'' don't belong in sci.crypt either.  * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt?    ``I just came up with this neat method of encryption. Here's some   ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a   doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.    If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some   ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by   random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the   opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is   distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some   systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts   and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but   this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most   sci.crypt readers won't bother with.    So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,   find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and   related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the   introductory textbooks.    When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at   large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens   of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily   answered on your own.    If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some   reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your   system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to   sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated   in some areas.)    If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.   You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted   cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break   Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough   experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will   be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to   consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more   layer of complication and come back for another round.    A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA   look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope   of this FAQ.\",\" in this regard that permission to export >>> PKZIP's encryption scheme has twice been denied by NSA.

Draw your own conclusions >>about the strength of the algorithm...  :-)  Sorry if I was less than clear.  :-) I was referring to our own efforts to receive export permission from NSA for the PKZIP encryption algorithm, not to any effort on the part of Phil Katz or PKWare.  I should point out that the original version of this algorithm was designed by Roger Schlafly and that WE (meaning Roger and myself) were twice denied an export license for it.  The second go 'round was just this past fall.  I had no knowledge of Phil's attempts in this.  I do not even *know* for sure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed by Roger, though I *believe* that was at least the case for versions prior to 2.0.  And then there's the question of key management.  :-)  And even if our applications were identical, there is no reason to assume the NSA would treat them that way.  :-)  -mjm \",\"Well, it looks like I'm F*cked for insurance.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems.  Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware (modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.  None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe (no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by \\\"holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up\\\" - Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.  Beyond this Apple suggest that \\\" you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo\\\". Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem.  Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome, particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)  cheers  brucet \",\"Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]        Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:    SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered \\\"paid advertising\\\" but rather \\\"public relations\\\", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is \\\"advertising\\\" as much as it is \\\"public relations\\\", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than \\\"public relations\\\", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \\\"The Last Action Hero\\\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \\\"would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.\\\"   This is being disputed, since the launch is a \\\"commercial launch\\\" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL \\\"BILLBOARDS\\\"    Orbital \\\"billboards\\\" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in \\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\\".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \\\"Eiffel II\\\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.                                                 (cont)\",\"  OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs (i.e., \\\"pork\\\") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still stands?  Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:  Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress? The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent each State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like Puerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in the past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest Territory?

But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : God's work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a Christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing. -- \",\"    Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?  Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the batter did something good.  I use the phrase \\\"happened to be\\\" advisedly. Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the most ability to \\\"turn it up a notch\\\" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by being in position.

There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.

The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky.   Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not \\\"everyone\\\" wants to help the side that is less like us.  I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is innocent.  There are just too many good reasons to stay away:  1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders    in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the    Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to    promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible    for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.  2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.

At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not.  And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around.

I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \\\"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\\\" For all of you \\\"found jeezus\\\" , how many of you were \\\"on the brink?\\\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \\\"non-believer\\\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.

On the non-pacifist side:]  (1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable than killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have no right to turn someone else's.  (2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have made His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the army, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.  [B. On the pacifist side:]  (1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army, or stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear whether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.  (2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at combatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.  (3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time. Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available to the general public.

Some involve modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.  All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new ways to \\\"crack\\\" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.  I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions, assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea, legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications, and are merely curious?  Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I can.

While most   leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the    economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area   of jobs creation.    The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \\\"It's the guns\\\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \\\"gun-nuts\\\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \\\"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\\\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \\\"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\\\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \\\"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\\\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \\\"Ban-One-A-Month\\\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \\\"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\\\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \\\"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\\\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \\\"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\\\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \\\"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\\\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \\\"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\\\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \\\"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\\\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit budget.    Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?  Any and all help would be very appreciated.  Many thanks,     ---Mark\",\"There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program about Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.  One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:  1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade    Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not    succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created    the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist    Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.  2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and    other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and    outlaw state.  3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I     suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and    perhaps intensify.  Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have been behind this. These include:  1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical    Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This    movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily    fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this     movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return    colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of    democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian    military coup against the democratically elected Algerian    Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.    A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news    on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.  2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia    and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil    sources from this region.  3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense    expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of    Soveit Union.  The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\",\"I had posted this before, but the buyer fell through, so here goes again....\",\"  Carl, it is not \\\"placebo effect\\\" if as hypothesised the  sensory response to MSG's effect on flavor is responsible for the MSG reaction.\",\" Lets see what the dictionary has to say:  objective adj. 1.

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry.  In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \\\"For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\\\", this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to Vol. 4 it says, \\\"Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For example, the translation:   Shift<Key>q: quit()  will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key (and the q key).  This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the control key, the shift key, and the o key.

From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just \\\"give\\\" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)    This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.   Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?   As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.   Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)   I tend to agree with you.  It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't proved lethal to humanity yet.   I have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know who first came up with the \\\"God-shaped hole\\\" business?   You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim like this.   I don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.  ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made.

The anecdotal experiences of individuals is ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate has made them sick.''

If nationialists take over and, even if they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.  How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something. A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is bound to have affects here.

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.   But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.   I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.  Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any tickets next season:-).\",\"This is a two-sided problem.

About 5 youths were disturbing my car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished.

But to suggest that a *disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is  taking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease for lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed blindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare say all of us would be walking into walls.  Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment\\\" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle?  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"\",\"  I see . . . you're not running Ultrix!   :-)      - - Steve  \",\"Hey!

By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel, the government of Israel,  the leaders of Israel (political and/or religious) or the jews in general?

How would you feel if we started condemning you personally based on the bombings in Egypt?   -- \",\" I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal of letting LE wiretap \\\"terrorists and drug dealers\\\" is to restrict stronger techniques.    Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or (the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.  The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic cryptography, and only by this restriction.  \\\"Clipper\\\" appears to be no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be labeled \\\"too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need\\\".   What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away with it. \",\" : Can anyone tell me where to find a MPEG viewer (either DOS or : Windows).  : Thanks in advance.  : --  : Alan M.

It is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the preceding comment is supposed to be funny.   And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by \\\"There is no way out of the loop\\\".  I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\" Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.

In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights.

After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm holding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down) and he can do nothing.  HOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are riding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise for you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact that it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans before you can dismount and deal with it properly.  By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama, it will just hop on and insist on a ride.

I played Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles.  The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  stop the almost indestructible zombies.    Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.     *********************************************************  - All prices include shipping. - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. - US buyers only please. - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,   priority USPS. - All games include all original materials including box, manual,   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.

If you have technical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.   I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).

I reckon for many it depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might  understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.\",\" Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term \\\"always\\\" is rather deceptive, I admit.      Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)    Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.      God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly  unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate  interpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?  \",\"Yes! what you are saying is absolutey true, but what you fail to mention is the fact that the LCIII uses the new 72 pin simms which allow 32 bit access to each simm.

Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:\",\"This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father's PC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE.

In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't heard anything from any international source about any concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey. However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well  recognized POW camp.    I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have decided to acknowledge their existence first but later changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do you think happened to them?

Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN  since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short  lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the  internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions  against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say? I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had their own share too.   Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there? I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press.  He keeps saying that \\\"This was no longer an issue for peace talks.\\\"  Also, you don't want me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as  a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions  among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish  custody.  [..]   I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international  community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack.  Injuries:  Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.  Roster Moves:  Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6'4\\\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night.  Lines:  Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game Summary:  If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.  The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike \\\"Mister\\\" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38  The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.  The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.  Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.  So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.  That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't remember that he's tied with.  Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

Why would God discriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the Gentile rules.  God has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the law.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls the law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can never be used as an instrument of salvation.

In short, I am happy with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17\\\" Magnavox went away.  It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.  In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.   K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second               Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M  The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....  I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.

Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting  Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.  I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.   \",\"I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.  In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude picture:   ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  |  |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+  |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +  |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +  |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +  |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+  |  ====================== Figure 1 ====================================  Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack, with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.  The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming.  Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right } functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click of a button, you can change this:      +---------+     + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+  to this:                     +---------+                    + title A +     +------------------------+     +   this is the          +     +     body of the        +     +      window, window A  +     +------------------------+   ===============  Okay.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:  #ifdef SHAPE  case F_SQUEEZELEFT:  { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };   if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))     return TRUE;    tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;   SetFrameShape( tmp_win );   break;  }  .... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and  squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { \\\"f.squeezeleft\\\", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc file:  Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didn't get out.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them.

As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces. Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist' camp.   Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something. And the previous posters were wrong, no?   Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

I believe one reason are the expansion teams.  Any thoughts?\",\"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \\\"safe\\\" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments \\\"turned off\\\" rather than just \\\"safed\\\".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....    I've heard the argument that an active but \\\"uncontrolled\\\" spacecraft causes \\\"radio noise.\\\"  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed \\\"safe\\\" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a \\\"pause\\\" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission \\\"drift\\\" phase.  So any holes in all this? \",\"[...] [...]   Oh, lord.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.  Computation: Define the auxiliary angles p and q by: sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)  Conclusion: L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!  But what is h? The cutoff function h is defined as follows:  h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1       = 1    if   s > 1       = -1   if   s < 1  As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles. Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic circle. \",\"I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I  know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few \\\"enlightened\\\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \\\"good\\\" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \\\"good\\\" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaine's doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \\\"treat\\\" it. If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane \\\"barrier\\\".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida \\\"bloom\\\" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a \\\"good\\\" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from \\\"Natural Healing\\\" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.    FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.   iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)       /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI    Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

There's quite a difference between Hollywood's \\\"Old West\\\" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks, saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while they really did care when thugs preyed on others.   We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work. Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other guns.  -andy\",\"Just a pointer to the article in the current Science News article on Federal R&D funding.

(now a Systemhouse co.)\",\" #I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,  I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me. Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel) image to black and white dots.  So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:  xwdtopnm <xwdfile> | # convert to PPM  [ppmtopgm |]  # .. to graylevel for smaller file to print  pnmtops -noturn | # .. to PostScript  lpr   # print  pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care: If you want your image to be 4\\\" wide, use:  pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4 -noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it  is high) -width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below) -scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a  width less than 4\\\", and will thus be printed smaller than 4\\\" wide.  If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4\\\", and  will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified  paper width.   In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,  but it will not blow it up automatically.  Hope this helps. Marcel.\",\"I read an article about the benefits of a VLB motherboard.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for          Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and          unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.      B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.      C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.          As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;          Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.      D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.          6:3.      E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives          of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;           Heb. 1:3.      B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph              1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.          2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important works:              a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.              b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                   4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.          3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following ways:              a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11              b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.              c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                   of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.              d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making                    salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.              e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of                   Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13              f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                   Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.              g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                    God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12              h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.              i.   He empowers for living and for service.                     Cf. Acts 1:8  \",\"[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]         For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word \\\"on faith\\\", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.\",\"      Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise, at the Civic Arena.       Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best  strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E. Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45, when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.       Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on;  what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

Does the religion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from Bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the government sides?

Thank you.\",\"  Ditto,\",\"My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.    So what's the point?    L.

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \\\"You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?\\\" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.

I developed my own method, which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\" just picked out this one point because it struck me.... why do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the messiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to christianity than other religions are.

It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell.          ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a \\\"just war.\\\"  \\\"Blessed\\\" after all, \\\"are the peacemakers\\\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.\",\"From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46   The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak  ------------------------------------    \\\"On the ancient peak of Ararat   The centuries have come like seconds   And passed on.\\\"     -Avetik Issahakian  by Yuri Danilov  Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: \\\"What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?\\\" And  though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30,  depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer,  and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions,  not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems.  Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they  were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for \\\"numbers\\\" (though  secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because  they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern  mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't  know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were  no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a  specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \\\"I willingly confess that  any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of  my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route --constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid  using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is  well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates,  nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers (nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It  seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade  teachers.\\\"  Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the  bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to  recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most  fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a  relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to Venus and back.     One for the \\\"road\\\"   They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley   glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with   a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \\\"God   knows what this kind of stuff leads to,\\\" thought Kingsley.   The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History   of Herodotus. \\\"Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,\\\" thought   the Royal Astronomer.      --Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud  The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24  elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these  problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian  architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is  now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant  letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of  Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.  An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a  bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh  Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).  The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way  of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and  worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years  the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in  Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk  Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has  brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the  general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable  problem book.    Vardapet Anania of Shirak   Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no   philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering   it the mother of all wisdom.      --Anania of Shirak  Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because  of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his  work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia,  Movses of Khoren).  In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:   I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our  Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately,   in the expression of the psalmist, \\\"every day I illuminated the   eyes of my mind.\\\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,  I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy,   the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia   neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the   sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man   named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me  that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,  Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But          soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but          only of certain fragmentary facts.   I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me:   \\\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the   coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full   of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\\\" I asked   them how they knew this. They answered: \\\"We saw ourselves that many   people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man.   Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,  Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become   pupils of Tyukhik.\\\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to   God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.   I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I   He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St.   Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself   lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\\\"   Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with   me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated   the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students  at the king's court began to envy me.   I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not   been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable   collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan,   books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why   enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did   not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating  that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into   Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the   translation read as if the work were written in that language   originally.   Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had   learned the Armenian language. \\\"When I was young,\\\" he said, \\\"I lived   in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and   for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I   served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and   literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was   wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to   the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \\\"If You prolong my life,   I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to   collecting treasures of knowledge.\\\" And the Lord heard my prayers.   After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria   and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher   from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned   to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\\\"   After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for   him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to   assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to   God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because  of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study   with him.   And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from   him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our   country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's   help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me   for my efforts.      Problems and Solutions   A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed  on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper;   one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and   forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many   copies were printed in all.      --Imitation of Anania of Shirak  A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\\\"books have their own fate\\\"). The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to  Armenian historians, \\\"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded  from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children.\\\" Biding their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of  ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts). And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two  manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction  and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited,  annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a  member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).  In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are \\\"amusing, full of life,  and simple.\\\" Orbeli goes on to say: \\\"The subjects of the problems are  generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland  Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are  named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a  contemporary of Anania.\\\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used  only \\\"aliquots\\\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to  represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).  Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the  retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their  full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.  Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D.  572.  Problem 1  My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the  Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary  heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops.  The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,  pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third  time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were  still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from  this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.  Problem 8  During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a  day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent  riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in  a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.  Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian  translation, they are all called \\\"dishes.\\\" But in the original Armenian,  according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are  called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian  word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before  Anania's Problems and Solutions.  Problem 18  There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the  metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten  drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.  Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in  Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.  Problem 7  Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank  of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast.  We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found  forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.  The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself and offer you just one more.  Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that  inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according  to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of  Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .  Problem 20  The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik,  was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and,  running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild  beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by  arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were  caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And  so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.    \\\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\\\"   His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a   bibliography.     -- K Uzbashyan, Academician      Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli  Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the  solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation  of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages, has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders,  and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great  attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for  a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma  attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An  advertisement at the end of the book reads: \\\"This book was typeset in  December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by  me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with  borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project  to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\\\"  Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned  orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage  Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had  already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis  Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its  rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish  the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian  churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve  the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the  blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)  When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times  were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the  printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the  Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography.     Back to Earth   This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important   works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty   of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame,   will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.     --V.

PST                     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING  on the aid package.        SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The  President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed  yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic  and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.          Before taking your questions and running through the  basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.   First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do  with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds  have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is  no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund  any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently  are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin  tomorrow.              The second point is that this package is designed to  support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package  are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have  been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian  government.              Third, the President is determined that we will  deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed  to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we  wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we  feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in  front of you.              Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of  trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's  capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of  governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do  so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make  trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.                They also agreed that there would be a new joint  commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by  Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through  the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote  a vastly expanded relationship.              If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down  the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just  give you some general background on what these programs are.   I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.              The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food  and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has  been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian  grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure  there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the  major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food  for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also  be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and  pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.              The second item is concessional food sales.  As you  know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship  with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia  that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the  Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.   The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are  concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,  but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on  principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates  thereafter for the life of the deal.              The third program is a collection of private sector  support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're  going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses  is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.   And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American  enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the  goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in  Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.                The President has also decided to create a  privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian  government in its priority objective of trying to convert state  enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has  also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a  Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by  prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.              The fourth grouping you see there in the summary  page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that  this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of  pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total  of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed  tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're  launching.                The President is also calling for the development of  a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to  try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public  efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in  Russia.              The fifth program you see is Russian office of  resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and  conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration  project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military  to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic  states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to  make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's  with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American  construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration  basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working  very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say  that we have a long-term commitment to this project.                The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They  are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our  initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the  possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and  gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in  the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much  environmental damage.              I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,  about the new group being created that the Vice President will  chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing  with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development  committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,  to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede  trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time  investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this  problem full-time.                And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and  investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an  analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we  just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a  commitment within our own government to have people work on it --  senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly  important.              You'll notice that the United States is going to  support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer  status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested  our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the  long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is  paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are  supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting  their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.                You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in  credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended  $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil  project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an  agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion  framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance  Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.  We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll  get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo  conference, the G-7 conference.              Before I take any further questions, I'd like to  defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance  objectives with you.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major  unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts  in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and  secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory  under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.    Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important  agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding  to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130  million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement  program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for  bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.              The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for  the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed  from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially  contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the  construction of that storage facility.                And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help  in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear  materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we  add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance  which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall  safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety  measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the  last couple of years.                So this is an area where we will be going a lot more  work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,  and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last  couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for  safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian  territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of  START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.               So we are working very hard with all the parties to  the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with  them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia  as a very important step in that process.              Q   The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in  Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with  Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the  same one, why do you feel it's necessary?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same  deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil  field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights  oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced  today.  So it's completely new.              Q   Can you tell us more about what's involved?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like  other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do  two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west  Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating  oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.   The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the  natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which  will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what  Russia needs.              So we think this deal is very, very good development  for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an  American company.  And the American government has played a  leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility  in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.              Q   So it's to search and also to renovate fields  that are already there?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   On that point, should other American companies  expect to get administration support for such deals, or should  they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2  billion?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,  Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the  U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department  and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we  think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,  there will be $2 billion in financing available for American  companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.              Q   That should take up all of the rest of the  deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be  support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a  tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas  companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and  gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will  soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may  even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.              Q   What's the current year budget costs of that  $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any  current year budget costs --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer  you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.              Q   The concessional food sales -- is there any  current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in  which the payments are due?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional  food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.   USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to  expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd  refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.              Q   Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?              Q      and the private sector -- how many folks are  going to be involved in that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start  with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt  coming into office that there were literally thousands of  organization, private organizations in the United States that in  one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve  democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.   And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that  had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the  administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try  to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give  some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the  efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.              It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will  soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in  the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might  use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of  our own government, but the resources of the American private  sector and schools and communities across the nation.              Q      any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word  yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated  besides the $300 million the President talked about?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration  is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What  the President has done this weekend is to consult really  intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional  measures the United States could take in some of these areas to  support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he  returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other  ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.              Q   Two questions about the $700 billion  agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of  consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.   So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you  explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans  for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit  into that situation?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the  United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains  and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think  between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history  here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through  the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle  to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of  last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on  that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and  therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that  program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and  other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we  could promote American grain sales.                And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've  announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the  Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient  authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked  for a concessional loan program.                I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a  short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but  a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what  this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are  worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of  principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the  life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of  interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we  believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal  for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments  and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this  very important grain relationship, which is important for them,  and it's important for the American farm community.              Q   I gather from what you say that this could make  it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC  loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,  is that right?               SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit  about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing   the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program  because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you  know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around  $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having  taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American  market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to  respond to a specific request from the Russian government for  major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the  grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,  we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to  great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with  the Russian government and arrived at this solution.                I think the Russians are pleased because it provides  them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on  the short-term payments.              Q   Where do those funds actually come from?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the  Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's  authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do  not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want  to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,  the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been  allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration  can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very  important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,  that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be  able to do so.              Q   How did you arrive at the figure of $700  million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually  have a range from 0 to --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason  for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us  that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and  harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the  shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the  harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the  same level of food imports from the West.              Q   I would imagine there's going to be some  considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other  republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.   Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for  the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with  some of the other republics?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very  conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending  American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet  Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the  area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that  you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and  roughly 50 percent to the other countries.               In the area of food sales, we have been active with  Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We  will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this  summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the  other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are  productive and they're hard-hitting.              Q   Has anything happened at the summit to lead  American energy companies and other companies to believe that  Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of  taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our  primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not  only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd  like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're  convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to  support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of  Western governments have the financial resources over the next  decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private  sector can do that.                We look at our own society and we see tremendous  capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very  good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial  investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new  technology and new capital to finance new production.                That's what the Russian government has told us it  wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis  on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on  the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently  last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President  Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong  signal to the American business community that we support their  efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to  support them.              Q   My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to  deliver on making Russia a more --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I  would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.  Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas  sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice  President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the  barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil  and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that  committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to  the work.              Q   What type of mechanism is already in place to  administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will  the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of  the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the  Russian government for distribution at their will?                   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking  about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the  program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working  through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure  that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to  the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the  Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can  account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of  months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of  these programs.              But they are all quite different.  For instance, in  the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it  is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of  the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working  through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the  housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,  we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the  democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian  private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with  journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have  noticed.              So we literally have here 30 to 40 different  activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be  carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the  Russian government, some with Russian citizens.              Q   The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and  on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the  President has to do on that?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George  noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in  the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's  fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we  return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and  we'll get back to the Russian government.              Q   You were not prepared for these questions when  you got here?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared  for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not  prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require  consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with  the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those  concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before  we take any action.              Q   Is this package designed so that you will not  have to go to Congress for anything at this point?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the  beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all  the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.   So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to  seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In  effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the  agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And  that's the advantage of this particular initiative.              Q   If this, as the President says, is a long-term,  long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment  heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to  Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are  prepared to go to Congress for various things?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been  clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with  President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American  funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a  major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by  Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that  delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.   And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where  it stands now.              Q   We've been told repeatedly that a number of  these items represent different or new ways of spending the money  already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these  items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways  that it was not previously set to be?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've  said that these are all projects that either Congress had  allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were  some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this  administration took office and had some new ideas about how the  funds might be expended.              We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or  the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to  further our programs.              And example of that is the Food for Progress  concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of  funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we  looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American  market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we  found it.              Q   Where, for example, are you getting the money  for this Russian officer resettlement --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the  Freedom Support Act funds.              Q   In other words, all of the money is being  directly spent in new ways, so to speak --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant  projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the  second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if  you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that  total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act  funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year  '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the  legislative history of those funds.              Q      cooperation --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I  don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.              Q   Could you tell us please, has anything happened  here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and  Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's  happened here --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this  issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security  and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's  session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly  reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been  talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple  of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the  discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very  important negotiation that's been going on essentially between  Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially  discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute  to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.                But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,  I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.              Q?     Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is  any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current  year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been  earmarked and put it into this fund?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and  mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We  could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included  out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to  many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the  privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already  talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.                We could have put in really big numbers and this  could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:   This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're  going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President  feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy  that the western governments, the combination of governments, put  up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not  able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is  determined, to carry out every single program in this package.   And we'll do it.                But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's  part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking  for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively  support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment  on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.              Q      taken it way from any --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.   Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;  so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in  Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.              Q   In terms of funding, there is no available  monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money  somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I  don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the  example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit  guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay  back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt  problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we  looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement  for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and  also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers  have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply  look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative  authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other  areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,  but we thought we should now.                 Q   Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package  for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by  initiatives put forward by President Bush?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think  that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were  appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This  administration took office and inherited some obligations that  the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven  week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments  that had been made by the previous administration.                But we have gone well beyond them in funding the  enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not  been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to  it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them  into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,  is another Clinton initiative.                Further, we listened to the Russian government and  listened to the Russian military who told us that the  resettlement of their officers was important to them for  political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton  has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment  that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out  a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.                I would also say that the President has given  impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly  about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we  have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends  itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the  creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,  we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private  sector as well as the American government, to achieve that  objective.                So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And  as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the  last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last  administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton  assistance package for Russia.              Q   There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the  past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this  outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money  will not just disappear because it's being administered by the  Russian government?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I  know that the President and other senior officials of our  government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and  that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's  intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the  State Department will take great care in making sure that the  funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their  source.              I would not that this package is not simply a  package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of  these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are  going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,  with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another  example of that.              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add  a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one  area that we've been looking at very, very closely is  consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting  for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,  of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime  contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of  a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that  funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in  Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent  efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.              Q   When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly  when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President  is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think  it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over  the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties  on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over  the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach  out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us  to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said  that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate  in a much more effective way the activities of our own  government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in  Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw  them together and to focus their efforts.              Q   Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will  actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any  figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something  up in the next couple of days on that.              Q   This figure is larger than the figure that has  been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result  of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and  I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put  us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was  briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the  intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of  the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we  had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have  been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week  going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in  Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.   And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been  together for about two weeks.              Q   Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There  was so much talk before about the President wanted to get  Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.   Is that in the out years?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.   President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,  that support for the creation of private businesses is important  to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is  important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize  the state industries is important to them.                And so what we did was to try to make those the  centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We  listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been  working with the Russian government for months on this trying to  work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of  these programs was involved every step of the way.                But let me get at the other part of your question.   The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader  set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking  for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the  table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in  housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to  consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other  allied governments that are also active.              Q   There's essentially nothing that happened in  the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that  you came in with?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular  package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks  ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on  the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've  primarily talked about future, about what more the United States  and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,  which is our base objective here.              Q   I noticed that you -- that money appropriated  to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me  what about job training for workers who are displaced by  privatization?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we  have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and  financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing  initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain  Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.              Q      money for job training for workers whose  jobs are disappearing because of privatization --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet  allocated any money for that.              Q   Why not?              Q      of the $6 million is going to build 450  housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the  Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do  housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework  of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've  got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think  about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also  retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming  out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.   We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers  as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian  government.              Q      of the $6 million will go to retrain --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.              Q   Are you talking about apartment buildings or  single --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about  single, individual dwellings.              Q   You're saying that only 450 families will be  served by this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I  thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.   What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the  Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building  housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with  a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next  couple of months and try to figure out with American  organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job  done.                I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.   And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into  this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to  spend the money wisely.              Q   What is it about this program that convinces  you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be  in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,  especially considering their other debt problem?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think  it's important to note that the United States on its own does not  have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.   It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to  our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what  the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We  can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do  so, which is consistent with our national interests.              Q   Did the President say that the value of the  U.S. contribution was that it would create security and  prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this  program that does this?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to  go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,  and that is we want to do everything we can to support the  continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay  in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear  forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,  which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in  Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that  this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we  have to make a long-term commitment to it.              Q   And then on the question of Russia's ability to  repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15  years from now?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian  government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping  is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve  their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency  revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years  from now to pay back those loans.              Q      substantial government-to-government loan  we've ever gotten into with the Russians?              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to  answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years  on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because  the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to  just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of  effort.              Q      government loans in any other sector that  you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --              SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair  to say this is a new and unique effort.\",\"Are you assuming that families in the inner city don't have family values ?

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people. Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--   ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan,  situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has been subjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About 30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are taking part in the attack.    Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupied the ruling height from where the town is shelled from \\\"Grad\\\" installations, this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20 people are dead. Population of the town is hastily evacuated.--0--   PRESS-CONFERENCE OF THE CHIEF OF PRESS-SERVICE OF PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Fifty-five thousand refugees from the region of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.    Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.    Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of  Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference in Moscow. Detailed information on latest events in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--   AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by Azerbaijani society \\\"Dayag\\\".--0--   PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW     BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of \\\"Sadval\\\" society picketed before the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow. Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed by Azerbaijan.    Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.    Society of Lezghins, \\\"Sadval\\\", registered in Moscow in 1990, demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--   ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of  Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs  the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.    In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.    Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of  Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army and local citizens, today.--0--   STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan  issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.    It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\"  I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.  The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry \\\"average\\\", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.  (And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they going to \\\"abandon\\\" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)\",\"Can anybody tell me if they know where I can obtain the source code for a polygon filling algorithm, or any other graphics orientated mailing lists that may be able to help me.

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older rare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:  Ford GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of  its races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.  Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?  Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)  THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model that I couldn't identify.  And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.  Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly sold in the U.S.  And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini. The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator  in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk and go to the outside from here. The taillights looked like they would be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the make of this one is?    Certainly made my day... \",\" This is a good point, but I think \\\"average\\\" people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their social life, or to get more involved with American culture, if they are kids of immigrants for example.  Since it is the overwhelming major religion in the Western World (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong TOO new, or TOO out of the ordinary.  Seems a little weak, but as long as it doesn't hurt anybody...    These are good quotes, and I agree with both of them, but let's make sure to alter the scond one so that includes something like \\\"...let him be, as long as he is not preventing others from finding their peace.\\\" or something like that.

Their popularity seems to come and go.  I remember when I first entered High School, I was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  At this time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to Christianity (they were all also immigrants from Taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross generalization).  Christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it ever has before (since I've been noticing).  Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning.  Who knows? I for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other: I have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  For all the well-put arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.

Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the \\\"central dogma\\\" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists\\\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis\\\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\\\"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\\\"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

Is this true, and if so, how does DESI deal with that?  -David\",\"I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.  The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be retrieved from  ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)  from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA. The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.  ==================================================================== ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously.    Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability. Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem.     Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user, which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems. Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while retaining its computational efficiency. ====================================================================  Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!    I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also welcome!  Stefan Brands, \",\"From Israeline 4/14  Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the peace talks. Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded that the delegates not go to Washington to, \\\"sell out the Palestinian people.\\\" One caller threatened, \\\"Should you go, you will not find your family alive upon your return.\\\" The newspaper states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others. \",\"   It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\",\"When using Photoshop is there anyway to get an elliptical dot for the halftone screen rather than a round dot ?

(X11R5).  Any pointers appreciated,  Gordon. \",\" Golly, I love stupid people. :-) Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL, there exist these things called \\\"ties\\\".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called \\\"wins\\\".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say \\\"the opponent\\\".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the \\\"better\\\" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.  HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished  of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only  the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian  Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of  Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines  genocide as acting with a     'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a     national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'   History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate  the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the  Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including  U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy  as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of  the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the  extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor  those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.   The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian  territories.  The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian  Government.  The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer goals than Hartford.

How will the bike perform with such a load  clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting,  do I still increase my chances of surfing?

Why is it okay to disbelieve because of your incredulity if you admit that it's a fallacy?\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.

The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because they were very interested in him.  Oh well.  Go CAPS!!!!!!!  Connin\",\"  Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"Hello all,  If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.

While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible.  This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.  The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.  Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.\",\" There was a Science fiction movie sometime ago (I do not remember its  name) about a planet in the same orbit of Earth but hidden behind the  Sun so it could never be visible from Earth.

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).  Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache?  I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses?

In any case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and license information, photographs, etc.   You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them. At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

I've had kidney stones 4 times  and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see  a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor. Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed  to make sure there is not a serious problem.\",\" To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \\\"You people call THIS science?\\\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.     Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a \\\"serious scholarly investigation\\\" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The \\\"science\\\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of \\\"reason and observation.\\\"  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\" Some VESA bios's support this mode (0x100).

Features:     Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.    No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).    Generic clients.    Customizable servers.    Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).    Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).    Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily         attached.  Functionality:    Client:    The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things    when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's    viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's    actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to    other users.     The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to    develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that    resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting    it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.     This release of the client software supports the following functionality:      o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)      o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)      o User Interface Panels      o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for  faster frame rates)      o Mouse and Keyboard Input     (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the    PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because    I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)    Server(s):    This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is    provided in this release for potential world server developers:      o Transparent Client Management      o Client Message Handling     This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of accepting and    terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer    can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.     Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is    what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:      o Server Selectable Extension Installation:         What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended         functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension         initialisers you want.      o Event Handler Registration:         When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback         functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.         (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)      o Collision Detection Registration:         If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide         some basic information to the collision detection management software.         Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.      This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because     the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects     from which to choose.      The following is all you need to make a World Server application:      o Provide an initWorld function:         This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus         any initialization you want to do.      o Provide a positionObject function:         This is where you determine where to place a new client.      o Provide an installWorldObjects function:         This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.      o Provide a getWorldType function:         This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.      o Provide an animateWorld function:         This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects         move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit         (to avoid outrunning the clients).      That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the     three world servers I've provided:          generic - 81 lines         dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                            stairs! Will probably be improved with future                            versions)         dogfight - 72 lines  Location:     This software is located at the following site:    ftp.u.washington.edu     Directory:    pub/virtual-worlds     File:    multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z  Futures:     Client:      o Texture mapping.      o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading      o HMD support.      o Etc, etc....     Server:      o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).      o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction      o Etc, etc....     Both:      o Improved Comms!!!  I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software, unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(  I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.

The number produced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first escrow house.  It programs the chips with its half the key, and prints out a paper slip with the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   The reams of paper are filed in locked boxes in the vault, a fuse is burnt in the chip so that the key is now unreadable.  The chip then goes to the next escrow house, where the same thing is done.  This continues through N escrow houses, perhaps, could be more than 2.  The last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker.  And yes, this has to be a public key system or it would be almost impossible to handle.  It might not be RSA, but that does not mean that PKP doesn't get paid.

Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain  'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and  a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag,  is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and  forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because  of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself:  is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human  rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to  let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.          The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92          By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday          The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be          little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian          fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.           Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the          Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of          how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25          February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the          surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in          one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were          shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I          also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift          hospital in a string of railway carriages.           Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by          Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov          Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to          his  town.   \\\" So where are the rest?\\\".  Some might have  taken          prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the          mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to          retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of          cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.           One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at          first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting          to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.          But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored          personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend          themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the          forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.           Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken          prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that          troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack          Khojaly. \\\"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\\\"    Serdar Argic\",\"Also note (from <branstad@tis.com> and <walker@tis.com>):  % whois -h rs.internic.net tis-dom Trusted Information Systems, Inc.

Here is an example of how to do this:  /* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */  /* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port  * directly.  * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.  * Will timeout when 'int count=0' counts up to zero.  * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).  * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out  * when either joystick is not connected.  *  * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as  * the joystick circuitry needs.  *  * Written by Eyal Lebedinsky (eyal@ise.canberra.edu.au). */  #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <conio.h>  extern int readjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2);  #define JOYPORT 0x201  #define XJOY 0x01 /* for joystick B use 0x04 */ #define YJOY 0x02 /* for joystick B use 0x08 */ #define XYMASK (XJOY|YJOY) #define BUT1 0x10 /* for joystick B use 0x40 */ #define BUT2 0x20 /* for joystick B use 0x80 */  int     /* returns 0 if ok */ readjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2) {  register int count;  register char temp, joy;   temp = (char)XYMASK;  count = 0;  outp (JOYPORT, 0);  /* set trigger */  do {   temp ^= (joy = (char)inp (JOYPORT));   if (temp & XJOY)    *x = count;   if (temp & YJOY)    *y = count;  } while (++count && ((temp = joy) & XYMASK));  *b1 = !(joy & BUT1);  *b2 = !(joy & BUT2);   return (!count); }  /* This main() is for demonstration. */  int main () {  int rc, x, y, b1, b2;\",\"I just wanted to know:\",\"[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say \\\"God just exists\\\" and can't say \\\"The universe just  exists\\\" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural  laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.\",\"  OTOH, some of us get lucky-- I've unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB quite often, and never blown anything.

John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)- _The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work  _The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper and Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament at the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988, And his latest book _The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins_ Harper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Mack's book on Q and then  examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your \\\"evidence\\\" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  Most of the tired arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case.

us.\"]},\"selected\":{\"id\":\"1114\"},\"selection_policy\":{\"id\":\"1113\"}},\"id\":\"1065\",\"type\":\"ColumnDataSource\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"formatter\":{\"id\":\"1108\"},\"group\":null,\"major_label_policy\":{\"id\":\"1109\"},\"ticker\":{\"id\":\"1047\"}},\"id\":\"1046\",\"type\":\"LinearAxis\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"formatter\":{\"id\":\"1111\"},\"group\":null,\"major_label_policy\":{\"id\":\"1112\"},\"ticker\":{\"id\":\"1043\"}},\"id\":\"1042\",\"type\":\"LinearAxis\"},{\"attributes\":{\"source\":{\"id\":\"1066\"}},\"id\":\"1089\",\"type\":\"CDSView\"},{\"attributes\":{\"coordinates\":null,\"fill_alpha\":0.5,\"fill_color\":\"lightgrey\",\"group\":null,\"level\":\"overlay\",\"line_alpha\":1.0,\"line_color\":\"black\",\"line_dash\":[4,4],\"line_width\":2,\"syncable\":false,\"xs_units\":\"screen\",\"ys_units\":\"screen\"},\"id\":\"1057\",\"type\":\"PolyAnnotation\"},{\"attributes\":{\"data\":{\"SUBSET\":[\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\",\"dev\"],\"__SEARCH_SCORE__\":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"color\":[\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\",\"gainsboro\"],\"embed_2d_0\":{\"__ndarray__\":\"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\",\"dtype\":\"float32\",\"order\":\"little\",\"shape\":[95]},\"embed_2d_1\":{\"__ndarray__\":\"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\",\"dtype\":\"float32\",\"order\":\"little\",\"shape\":[95]},\"fill_alpha\":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],\"index\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,

What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)  2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)  Just wondering.... \",\" I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

However, I think that your rules are MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of course, there will have to be new \\\"sub-positions\\\", like the power center who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him, and the \\\"shooting defenseman\\\" and the \\\"point defenseman\\\".  Finally, we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers.  Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.    ;-) ;-) ;-)  --     Keith Keller    LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3 DAVID WILLIAMS  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, free agent from New Jersey Grade:  C/C-  IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that '91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4 JAYSON MORE  Season: 2nd Acquired: '91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft Grade:  B+  After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5 NEIL WILKINSON  Season: 4th Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B-  Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6 SANDIS OZOLINSH  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade:  I (A)  At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called \\\"rookie mistakes,\\\" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19 DOUG ZMOLEK  Season: 1st Acquired: '91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade:  B  Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\",\" National Rifle Association 1600 Rhode Island Ave. NW Washington, DC 20036-3268 1-800-368-5714 (membership) \",\"Has anyone heard anything about Mel Hall this season?

Adam Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\"   Exactly.   C. S. Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately. First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- \\\"a great coward.\\\"   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.   - Phil -\",\" : First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the : Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil : production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  : Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would : use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.  I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S. and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy  their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany, Japan and many other \\\"industrial rivals\\\" more than these two.   In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B.,  propping up these economies and further providing an incentive  to keep prices from falling too low.\",\"    Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.  I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...  PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called \\\"PEX\\\".  PEXlib is a slightly \\\"lower\\\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X.  Some advantages of using PEXlib... - Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of \\\"policy\\\" - PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support   features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).   PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.  Some advantages of using PHIGS... - Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones - Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.  If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that both API's have a lot in common.\",\"  You and Mr. bobby really need to sit down and decide what exactly Islam  *is* before posting here.

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce.

Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\"  Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade  from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.    As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from  those who don't know what it is.  --ccm  --  Christopher C. May * U. of Ariz.

Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US  Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.  At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC, Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government.  Ahmet said \\\"our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights. What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid.\\\" He added: \\\"What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination.\\\"  Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said \\\"We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States.\\\"  \\\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights.

If your name is Turkish, you are not hired to the government offices.\\\"  \\\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career.\\\"  \\\"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk.\\\"  \\\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\\\"  In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the Turkish candidates.  Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.  In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.   Serdar Argic\",\" Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??

The parts are mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest. We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask. Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.  The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu  as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography  FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.    Contents:  * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key? * What references can I start with to learn cryptology? * How does one go about cryptanalysis? * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance? * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem? * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice? * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?   * What is cryptology? Cryptography? Plaintext? Ciphertext? Encryption? Key?    The story begins: When Julius Caesar sent messages to his trusted   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. So he replaced every A   by a C, every B by a D, and so on through the alphabet. Only someone   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.    A cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so   that only certain people can see through the disguise. Cryptography is   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. Cryptanalysis is the art   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when   you're not supposed to be able to. Cryptology is the study of both   cryptography and cryptanalysis.    The original message is called a plaintext. The disguised message is   called a ciphertext. Encryption means any procedure to convert   plaintext into ciphertext. Decryption means any procedure to convert   ciphertext into plaintext.    A cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. The   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. For instance,   Caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different   values of n. It's natural to say that n is the key here.    The people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are   called recipients. Other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,   eavesdroppers, or third parties.  * What references can I start with to learn cryptology?    For an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. However,   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and   mathematical than historical. The Codebreakers by Kahn [KAH67] is   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up   to the mid-60's.    Introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from Gaines [GAI44] or   Sinkov [SIN66]. This is recommended especially for people who want   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.    The selection of an algorithm for the DES drew the attention of   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. Consequently   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. The   book of Denning [DEN82] gives a good introduction to a broad range   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,   access control, and formal models of security. Similar comments   apply to the books of Price & Davies [PRI84] and Pfleeger [PFL89].    The books of Konheim [KON81] and Meyer & Matyas [MEY82] are quite   technical books. Both Konheim and Meyer were directly involved in   the development of DES, and both books give a thorough analysis of   DES. Konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses   of many classical cryptosystems. Meyer and Matyas concentrate on   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and   networks.    The books of Rueppel [RUE86] and Koblitz [KOB89] concentrate on   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.  * How does one go about cryptanalysis?    Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern   finding, patience, determination, and luck. The best available   textbooks on the subject are the Military Cryptanalytics series   [FRIE1]. It is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given   systems. Such experience is considered so valuable that some of the   cryptanalyses performed during WWII by the Allies are still   classified.    Modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,   or taking a discrete logarithm. These are not the traditional fare   of the cryptanalyst. Computational number theorists are some of the   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.  * What is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?    In a nutshell: If f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can   find x by trying every possible x. That's brute-force search.    Example: Say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. He can simply try encrypting the   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.   Every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this   brute-force search is impractical.        Advances in technology sometimes change what is considered   practical. For example, DES, which has been in use for over 10 years   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. A computation with   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the   mid-70's. The situation is very different today given the dramatic   decrease in cost per processor operation. Massively parallel   machines threaten the security of DES against brute force search.   Some scenarios are described by Garron and Outerbridge [GAR91].    One phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.  * What are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?    The security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.    A strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  The   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is   probably strong.    A strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [CAE90]).        A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. A   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.    If a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily   strong? Certainly not. Many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.   However, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is   strong by mathematical proof. ``If Joe can break this system, then   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring   integers.'' See part 6.  Failing that, it's a crap shoot.  * If a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?    Cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. For instance, he might   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. If the crib is   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the   rest of the message. Or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. Thus   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he   doesn't have a chance.    Sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. The one-time pad,   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! Even   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. See   [KAH67].    * Why are many people still using cryptosystems that are   relatively easy to break?\",\"thought I'd post this as well as e-mail it, just in case anyone else is interested in this info.....

It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.\",\"Does anyone know if a Nanao 750i is compatible with any popular Mac video cards?

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.  \",\" >say they have a \\\"history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]\\\"? \",\"...   It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.

The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).

I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions are:        Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?

Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville  before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the  majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he  became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation  as an outstanding defensive catcher.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation  coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       \\\"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,\\\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         \\\"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\\\" he continued.  \\\"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.\\\"       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       \\\"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,\\\" Margitan explained, \\\"and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\\\"       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                        \",\": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged : couple become \\\"married\\\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)\",\"I'm getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little advice.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely \\\"abberant\\\".  ----  ET   \\\"Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE FOR THEIR REVIEW.   They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers.  Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400.   AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).  If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.  P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie: games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip (ie: stealth and actix cards.)

I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites).  Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.   Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.  Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:  * Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future  * Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...  If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out, but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to program).

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque (that's a paraphrase of what I remember).  In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.     Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.   The A's also objected about this.    Again, I'm just repeating something I heard.
