The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence. In this case, it is for one that the gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been seen. Further, there are zillions of other spook stories, and one would hardly consider others even in a religious context to be some evidence of a resurrection.   There have been more elaborate arguments made, but it looks as if they have not passed your post filtering.       It is no evidence in the strict meaning.

Serdar Argic\",\"  How about this description: \\\"An object that is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle\\\"? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist. The description is inconsistent, and hence describes an object that could not exist.  Now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, \\\"That object is, at one time, both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle.\\\" This does not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description was incorrectly applied.    The atheist says, \\\"The descriptions of God that I have been presented with are contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist.\\\"  Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of It.  This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and, when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one, are told that it is a \\\"Euclidean circle-square\\\".

And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as Israelis ?  2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ?  3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so, could you provide any evidence ?  4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ?  5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?  6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?  7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ?  8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim?  9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?  10.

Luck,\",\"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.  The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac tests memory, etc. Just before the \\\"happy Mac face\\\" normally shows up, the power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable.  It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had it for over a year).  Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator (both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\"I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like   /**/#This is a makefile  at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C  preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that  I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the  line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the  start of a directive.    However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol  as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines  that \\\"This\\\" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my  imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better  fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular  use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp  gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

Mr Orwell would love this.                                                   ^^^^^^^^^  Telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA, IDEA, or even DES. The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.   I would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun- ications than this lot.   Normmaly DES.                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Note the use of the word \\\"business\\\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \\\"business\\\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NSA   Yeah, this bit is VERY true.   Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo of the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment I suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.                                  ^^^^^^^^^                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                                   Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \\\"ensure\\\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.   Just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.    Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.   Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it. After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own actions.                                                  ^^^^^^^^  Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                    ^^^^^  Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.   The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.   Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people' will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.   Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical purposes by the middle of the next century.   It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.   Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be rephrased as \\\" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light amusement before breakfast.\\\"   This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is  a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?   Just make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.

He needs a grammar lesson too.   I would say \\\"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ), less available, and more prone to being comprimised\\\" Proofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.   They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the Mexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous gesture.   The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \\\"false assessment\\\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non- question. \\\"If what is here was not possible...\\\"   It indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert suitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of freedom and ultra-national sentiment.   This one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the keys, and the algorithm.

Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a     believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is    good. Blah blah blah.  That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To say that something produces only good because it is only good that  it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And all you're application is saying that it's true if you really  believe it's true.  That's silly.  Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).

By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith.

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one  of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles  Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT  translation in the New American Bible.  He noted \\\"...certain practices have  been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality,  and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.\\\"  I note that at my  parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the  offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word \\\"risen\\\".  This was not a  kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?\",\" Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.

If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music  into the landlord's home all day and night, then I could see how the opinion would be justified.  But this court order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy of anyone inside the clinic.     Perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public property.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters  outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the  protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how  is that different from the abortion protesters asking women  to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?     Even if the protesters' speech could be considered \\\"harassment\\\" (which it is not), hate speech laws have  generally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see  how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is  murder'' could be considered harassment.   Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying quietly on a public sidewalk.

When you get your home brew receiver working, would you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.  pin 1:  signal ground pin 2:  signal pin 3:  always hot +6 volts pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors  The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver. They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver.

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.    a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the \\\"memory aperture\\\" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \\\"help me\\\" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.    a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus    a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.    a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.    a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.    a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed confirmation.

That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now, and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear, and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that they're considering banning alternatives.  Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal - you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government) you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission, and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't start offering a secure service.  \",\": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.

First of all how could he start Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in baseball.

What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number?    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.

It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost  irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good (or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.

Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy, and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.  \",\": I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for  : the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to : all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of : Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made : obsolete by Jesus.  Just for reference, here's the earlier quote: Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25: : These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a : direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable. : Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in : the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And : not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew : and Gentile alike.  These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus change that?  : If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the : following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?  : I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly made the means look frightening.  However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough to debate with these people.  : Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.  No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing the will of God.  : Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.  Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.  : God be with you,  Not yours, thanks ;)  : Malcolm Lee  :)  Rob Lanphier lanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872@uidaho.edu  And for the curious, here is my earlier post:\",\"L(>  |JB>  1) Ron...what do YOU consider to be \\\"proper channels\\\"...

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator, NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.  Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators.  One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.  Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.  First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later. This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup is in order.  By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC, Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies. Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now.  Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of several.\",\"Thanks, Steve, for your helpful and informative comments on Mac stereo sound.

I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in \\\"contraceptive technology\\\" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach \\\"safe drug use\\\" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in \\\"how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs\\\" would increase drug use?  Why isn't \\\"drug abstinence education\\\" barred from schools because it teaches \\\"religion\\\"?

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\\\"  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with that: substitute \\\"Moslem\\\" or \\\"Buddhist\\\" or \\\"Satanist\\\" instead of \\\"Christian\\\", and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you've got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.\",\"Mouseless operation is documented in the man pages for olwm and olvwm...

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The \\\"Introduction\\\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \\\"OK\\\" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...  So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title (James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think I recall a (older) series under the name \\\"Harper Commentaries\\\".  Also there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD.)  My favorite one-volume commentary is the \\\"New Jerome Biblical Commentary\\\".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC, finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO, but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was \\\"normal\\\"). The short answer is no, don't accept these \\\"imperfections\\\" as \\\"normal\\\" because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and if you're persistent, you'll receive it.  \",\"Charles Parr, on the Tue, 20 Apr 93 21:25:10 GMT wibbled:  : >If Satan rode a bike (CB1000?) would you stop to help him?  : Of course!

I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.   The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively  computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume  that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not  exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable  measure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment  of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two  triangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw  and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is  along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge  colored with a special \\\"edge color\\\"   It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.\",\"    No need to correct it, it stands as it is said.         You miss the point entirely. Things defined by contradictory language do not exist. Though something existing might be meant, conclusions drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of the described then. Another possibility is to drop the contradictory part, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well.     Neither am I. But either things are directly sensed (which includes some form of modelling, by the way) or they are used in modelling. Using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of.

I'm not having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.  The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does (which makes no sense to me).  The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So you can't actually edit any colors.  We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around  in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have  no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the  above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail  for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.  Any hints?  Please respond with email as I don't regularly read this group.

Price is $200 plus s/h.   Austin Harris\",\"  First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!).  The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain.  Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no \\\"unassigned\\\" (as opposed to \\\"unused\\\") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to \\\"existing, unused\\\" drive letters.  I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well.\",\"   You can order one from Digital today.

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism, I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous philosophy.  I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.\",\" In my case it goes down after the first four, because the fifth one usually makes me throw up the last two.

These were the first two RBIs.  The third came later when Weiss was knocked in. \",\" Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I  would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a \\\"lock-up\\\" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.\",\"    I'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the original search warrant.   Independant Negotiators? What was there to negotiate? Any sort of plea bargin has to be brought to the court, the negotiators can't negotiate charges or sentences. FBI negotitators did make a deal for the Dividians to come out. Koresh showed he was not negotiating in good faith and there is no reason to believe independent negotiators would have done any better.\",\"Yesterday, I got the chance to hear Kurt Vonnegut speak at the University of New Hampshire. Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the  (honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is an atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov's funeral, Vonnegut stood up and said about Asimov, \\\"He's in heaven now,\\\" which ignited uproarious  laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time of the funeral)    \\\"It's the funniest thing I could have possibly said to a room full of humanists,\\\" Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture.            If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university, I highly recommend going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. In my opinion, he's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)      Peace,\",\"I had a GE Emerson 13\\\" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day, while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause), we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound, so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV. The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..   Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one (we wanted a bigger one too!).  After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?  I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).\",\"Well, that would depend on how much we wanted the US and how much we wanted the $1, wouldn't it? -Ekr \",\"      It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital  source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year, remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. The same VLBI was used to track Gallileo as it passed the Earth, and used so little fuel that it can afford to observe Ida.   \",\" Not in Indiana:  they showed a tape-delay of Chicago v Boston, because WGN had the rainout of the cubs.

I configured the systems as follows:   Eight (8) Mb RAM  Ethernet  1 Mb VRAM  Math CoProcessor option  My purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent me the Apple summary documentation to prove it.  I ordered the coprocessor option, but I'm really not sure that we needed it.  I thought the '040 chip had a math coprocessor built into it.  Has Apple had a math coprocessor chip architectured to keep up with the speed of the '040 chip in the Centris 650? I am concerned that I may have set up a hardware bottleneck.

If it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car eats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the muffler too is also ok.   The mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.  The 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.   Well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a car with highway miles.  Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he has been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets, a hard driven car 6-10 sets.    Well, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stuff for Japanese cars can be expensive.   1995 model year, I believe. \",\"A surplus-dealing buddy of mine came up with two emulator pods:   HP64220C (for HP 64100 development station). 8086 target  processor.

This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors. The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.  For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together.  1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files  2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer     in each file.  3. concatinate all the parts into a single file  4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).

But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No other demand is necessary.   You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development, the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less than 18 months after the development go-ahead.\",\"  COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00 for a brick.

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them.   I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.)   The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from \\\"unbiased\\\" sources, such as testing labs, columnists, etc.    I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and the results of anything else in the universe on these things.   Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired \\\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack\\\" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization,\\\" in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the \\\"Bart Simpson optimization\\\" because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right \\\"I will not cheat on benchmarks\\\" a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)   We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.  There used to be a lawyer in Montana who didn't, but he died.   -- Robert  \",\"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \\\"full consideration\\\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \\\"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\\\"\",\"   If you want to have some fun.

Capitalization rules in the late 18th century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current capitalization rules.  We also don't make 's' look like 'f' and other such things done in the late seventeen hundreds.  In the original Constitution, \\\"militia\\\", \\\"arms\\\", etc. were capitalized simply because they were nouns.  This is also done currently in German.  There is no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized. The capitalization denotes no special emphasis.  -Pete Zakel  (phz@cadence.com or ..!uunet!cadence!phz)\",\"There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess: 1) When they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: \\\"What's it all about.

I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange, either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call.      Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally- signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit, stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.      It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications....\",\" Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"Southern California RideList -- 4/14/93    Please send me any updates to this ride list.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential analysis).  Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:       1) Transmit Channel       The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with      a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number      unrecoverable with just the system key   2) Recieve Channel       The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number      with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number      is necessary for local operation).  This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large, making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.  IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number.\",\"Oh, excuse me for wasting the bandwidth, but I was referring to  the original incident, not the recent skirmish which occurred this past month.  \",\"From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich) -BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic) - --- -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com -    I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.    If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In search of the Indo-Europeans\\\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica. The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim.\",\"  I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds attractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be contaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in scripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has promised to give you light, so ask for it.    Don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to always compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.\",\"I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an \\\"Objection!\\\" heard in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.   This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the \\\"we did it on purpose\\\" thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.

An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.  But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully.  I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?   Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it. \",\"I need to find a UART that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:  -250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity  -ability to do BREAK detect (IRQ or output pin)  -IRQ on character received  I'm using a Dallas DS2250 at 16 Mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do  break detect.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.

VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.      Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel   Gaza and the idea of separation  The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \\\"You look for me !\\\", i.e., I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \\\"government of peace\\\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \\\"Rabinic\\\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): \\\"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  \\\"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\\\".\",\" A Sea Doo is a boat.

Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.         Compute the 64-bit block                  R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]          (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.  The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire \\\"programming session\\\" to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be thrown out if desired).  The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding for each value).  The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies.

Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree with it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)  I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the Serial-Number.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting space, but I thought you might want some relief from the \\\"So-and-so is a thief\\\" posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while.  After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50 in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day.  Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my software from him.

I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++.  My question is:  How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++.

It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.  One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself  against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)  made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.    I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know   that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.    It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such   comments in advance of forensic pathology.   Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.      Yah.    BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:  a) No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.  b) Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?  c) .... ah God:     25 children    at least 64 adults    plus 6 at the beginning    and more BATF agents     all dead.    Has anyone asked themselves these questions:   1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the    opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:   a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting     part comes out.   b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do     not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?  2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission    video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?    a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?    That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are    twounits on the professional handhelds (so no    tape turnover gaps)?   b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point    fingers in either direction.   As you well point out, Stephen.    More on this below.    Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full  pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.    More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended  that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --   a contradiction in terms.    True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out  from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.    This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note  that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today  is one where the Government:    wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.    Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.  ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves  the coin.     Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:    Money   made   in the image   of God    I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.  The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my  exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney  is:    I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.    25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF  helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.    The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely   straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences   havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that   Koresh or his followers caused this.    The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations   and morals (\\\"not my fault, Koresh did it!\\\") than they   are with:     25 dead children.   Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.    More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).   Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever  token of objective law and justice a society has had,    Hitlerrs have followed.    You do your name sake proud, Stephen.  Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:   each voice in the wilderness now will   save a generation unborn from horror    The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this  society is the day that society is already beyond redemption    and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian   belief aytall.   ... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the  act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the  wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or  punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to  be a human society, and become a society of animals.    We are _very_ cclose to that.    Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be  patient.  For those who like contrary questions:   NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law  official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.  The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the  equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake  of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:    innocent until proven guilty.  not   innocent until presumed guilty.   1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.    Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard   equipment.   2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?    a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This     aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable     as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.     .... gotcha!      ... when in isolation from other substances.      WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote     launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce \\\"this window,     blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come     down\\\", and maintain a left to right sequence?    b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when     mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)     suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to     brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long     exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend     to ignite.     What other chemicals come up in the forensics?    Who else will be allowed to test the site?    c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation     rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made     to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature     above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain     heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length     of time (start a wall fire and wait).     Check your military records; look at the tapes.    Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),    tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why    the hurry. was there still a comm channel open    to the outside?).     Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the    compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones    are missing?   Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.  You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?   IN advance of a Court?  God help us.    (For we are surely not helping ourselves).  You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?    You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.   Look again.   Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.   AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.  But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance   to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.  No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.   Listen to your hearts, people.

Unfortunately, I was unable  to post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm  posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of  regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be  useful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an  example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters  and data related to organ transplantation and donation.

Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman  trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant  Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University  Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in  transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is  a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and  always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a  very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our  hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence  will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be  cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome  Dr. Teperman.             WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE   LAST MEETING  It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of  TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being  able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.   No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored  again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island  Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many  braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good  conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,  a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not  able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to  discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,  an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient  was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year are:           Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two year's experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.   And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough  winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\",\"Hi,   I have a Quantum ProDrive LPS 40 MB SCSI hard drive for sale.

In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

People have said that religion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc., but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion, but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.  So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual, or even for a general population.

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains  unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often  look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree. For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so  sure the atheists can be counted out.   For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham, or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres, more important than God promisimg?

Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).

If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars! Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input to the bar normally associated with countersteering.  As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.

I do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been a good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as  much as we think.   I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder  when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians  who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of  absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some  very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the  truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have  the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of  room for others' opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to  use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are  very careful that you don't hurt others with it.

Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of  certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even  today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should  be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half  a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'  Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name  of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.  But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul  by the name of 'Cons*.'  How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact, for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New  World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later.  Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for  'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the  Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the  laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist,  any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil  of Anatolia.  These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It  is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock, stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.  In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:  The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians, the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as  their territory. But, it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only  40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.  Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and  the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony.  Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront  reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only  facts count.  As for Selanik,    <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled   particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially   as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the   total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks   led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to   the great port of Izmir.    Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual   murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek   efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912   and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,   when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>    <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow   Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to   practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923   which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new   Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a   series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where   most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This   was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting   Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also   on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica   for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By   killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a   substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting   Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the   occupation of Greece starting in 1941.    Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for   Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.   Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received   thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by   the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in   flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained   independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the   Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during   and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements   in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among   its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim   refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the   Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly   to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as   800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and   east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more   came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-   1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,   with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the   Empire.>>  [47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de   Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;   Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,   12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU   Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek   children in the streets of Salonica.

Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return   memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does   not shrink).    Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around   that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,   including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more   shared memory segment.   Terrible, but it works.      Regards,\",\"This is probably a stupid question but as I am new to the motorcycle scene I don't really know anything about it.

I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program).  The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the  rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the  rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters.  If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to find it, it would be much appreciated.

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \\\"sphere from 4 poits\\\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).\",\": >> The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime,  but the legal : >> shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court : >> battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what : >> it should be.

If his conscience forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate this system of government-sanctioned slavery.   If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY) and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia), we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending, but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the  infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)   A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the  most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody says something, yes the letter is a bit \\\"sharp\\\" in tone.  I have been writting reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return in the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events in Texas REALLY have me pissed.  -------------------        April  20, 1993 Representative Skaggs,  Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response you stated that \\\"Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians. My question to you is, \\\"what grounds would you use to deny them access to  firearms?\\\"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms. I say this because there are only two possible paths of \\\"gun control\\\" which you could have been referencing.  Either: 1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the \\\"cult\\\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult!  This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \\\"thought crimes.\\\"  You and Pat Robertson should really get along.  2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the \\\"cult.\\\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.  I have heard claims that they were \\\"stockpiling weapons.\\\"  Yet considering the number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged \\\"stockpiling?\\\"  Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for \\\"reasonable\\\" restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain 250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your \\\"reasonable\\\" gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you representing Sarah Bradys'?        Thank You,          William J.

My question to you is, \\\"what grounds would you use to deny them access to  firearms?\\\"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms. I say this because there are only two possible paths of \\\"gun control\\\" which you could have been referencing.  Either: 1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the \\\"cult\\\" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your Church to be a cult!  This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of \\\"thought crimes.\\\"  You and Pat Robertson should really get along.  2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the \\\"cult.\\\"  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted  him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.  I have heard claims that they were \\\"stockpiling weapons.\\\"  Yet considering the number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged \\\"stockpiling?\\\"  Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for \\\"reasonable\\\" restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain 250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your \\\"reasonable\\\" gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you representing Sarah Bradys'?        Thank You,      William J.

I  get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the scrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime! Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and keep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And of course some occasional sun. \",\" The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.   I agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.\",\" It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the other day I was thinking of doing the same.  I like those lyrics, since whenever I am approached by judgemental, pharisitical, evangelical fundamentalists who throw the Bible at me because I have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to Black Sabbath, I have something to throw back.  Usually their chins drop and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics.  It just goes to show that there are more important evils in the world to battle than rock lyrics...........  \",\"My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target, then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to harm.  But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away, heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this moment is hazy.  I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not. So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!  Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.  What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?  I eagerly await comment.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.  I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life. I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to it. Peace AND justice.   If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully  entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support.   Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts. Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians.   Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.  When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.  I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.\",\"[...]  [...]  I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big).  All 'spooks' in the Navy are required to know the \\\"gist\\\" of \\\"USSID 18\\\", the Navy-way of naming a particular Presidential \\\"Executive Order\\\".  It outlines what spooks can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals.  The following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED.  The whole issue hangs about what you mean by \\\"wiretap\\\".  If the signal can be detected by \\\"non-intrusive\\\" means (like radio listening), then it may be recorded and it may be \\\"analyzed\\\".  \\\"Analyzed\\\" means that it may be either deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.

It seems that people frown upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that. Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.   - Most interesting human traits will probably be massively polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.\",\"   Nope, it's 24 lbs. lightrer than the 900.   A single disk that is quite impressive.

It's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all, Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.   And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in St. Andrew of Crete, among others.  And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a big hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as far as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).\",\"Hello,      I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper \",\"  Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12.

The question is, is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar.  Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike, through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along  a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change  surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact  patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It  probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice,  but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like  because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a  better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface. You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it.  Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple. Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels. How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels. I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect. Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn. So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's, a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have countersteering.  Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm  willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering.   If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\",\"Archive-name: atheism/resources Alt-atheism-archive-name: resources Last-modified: 11 December 1992 Version: 1.0                                Atheist Resources                        Addresses of Atheist Organizations                                       USA  FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION  Darwin fish bumper stickers and assorted other atheist paraphernalia are available from the Freedom From Religion Foundation in the US.

PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  \\\"Galactic Pot-Healer\\\" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  \\\"A Maze of Death\\\" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  \\\"VALIS\\\" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  \\\"The Divine Invasion\\\" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it \\\"right\\\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \\\"old world\\\" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  \\\"The Bible\\\" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  \\\"The Existence of God (Revised Edition)\\\", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with \\\"The Coherence of Theism\\\" (1977) and was concluded with \\\"Faith and Reason\\\" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\".  In the revised edition of \\\"The Existence of God\\\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  \\\"The Miracle of Theism\\\", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \\\"replacements for God\\\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation's mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly to:\",\" This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe.  Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:  - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:  - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)  I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.  Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be  the best way to do it? \",\"long disk   I don't know how many times I've posted this the net.  No one EVER listens.

No, I'm not buying in bulk, I'm not getting a special deal.  $.75 a meg is good in my book, Approching floppy price.  Any questions on my source can be sent to ctr@po.cwru.edu. \",\"    Each chip includes the following components:        the Skipjack encryption algorithm       F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips       N, a 30-bit serial number       U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys.     To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is    first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.    S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a    64-bit block R1:      R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .     Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and    N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]      R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .     R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The    first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The    rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2    are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow    agencies.  Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a \\\"fail safe\\\" for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective \\\"master keys\\\" (along with F), the theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities) completely obviates the security of the system. However, more interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1 and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door?  I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin.  Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security.  If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and, soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late.     As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are    written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a    file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part    U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third    disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent    2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.    After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the    vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional    assurance that no information is left behind.  None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of \\\"destroying the laptop\\\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction. We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing this in a \\\"vault\\\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the    room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,    and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to    the escrow agencies.  What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"This is message is only of interest to those going to  International Symposium on Circuits and Systems that is being held in Chicago this May.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \\\"take\\\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \\\"winning spirit\\\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.

But didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or other? I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.   Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before \\\"the night of the long knives\\\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment) called \\\"Homosexuals in History\\\" asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.   Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books, look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \\\"knight of the long knives\\\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've  read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me.    I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that  all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about  homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they  would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one  should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case.    If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving), then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to archival material - most people on the net are not.   Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?  I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a  product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality, would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.  In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various  pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote  homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So  it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis,  regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \\\"evils\\\" of homosexuality. Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all  societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.  No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access  to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.         \",\"A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;  // in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app; // of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\\\"blaaa\\\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++) // real prog returns when \\\"Exit\\\" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \\\"test\\\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app; // use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(\\\"sleeping...\\\\n\\\");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the \\\"sleep\\\" in the main prog, despite the XtDestroyWidget call).  Anyone see something I'm missing?  Thanks very much.

And why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is God trying to confuse us?   But that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of  denominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding from varying translations of biblical texts by \\\"serious students\\\" that are much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible, then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be no need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe the Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to read it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us something we cannot use correctly.   IMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book, you are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE the Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language, all languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation of the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.

So far, Israe  continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they  leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that  the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction.... and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tim:   There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in  exchange for pieces of paper, \\\"expectations\\\", \\\"hopes\\\", etc. The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that these \\\"tangible concessions\\\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions. By \\\"tangible\\\" is meant something that 1) provides Israel with \\\"comparable\\\" protection (from the land it is to  give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine  **will be** accountable and held actively (not just \\\"diplomatically)  responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens  or \\\"visitors\\\").  In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**  co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel  from its territory.  Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  how *could* such \\\"guarantees\\\" be instilled? For example,  how could such \\\"guarantees\\\"/\\\"controls\\\" be added to the  Palestinian PISGA proposals?  Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \\\"buffer zone\\\", gives full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could (and *would*, if not \\\"controlled\\\" somehow) EASILY return to the  traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen.\",\"In my last post I referred to Michael Adams as \\\"Nick.\\\"  Completely my error; Nick Adams was a film and TV actor from the '50's and early '60's (remember Johnny Yuma, The Rebel?).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.  I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel.\",\"    Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness, being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.

This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s), since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.

What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above).  Well, here's my latest followup...

What version of the Bible do you read Mike ?  Jesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.'  Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way and that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns.

Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three devices, fourth one causes major problems).  First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system. If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive.

I quote:    \\\"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the   Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the   the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear Arms ....\\\"  - Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).  Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation.  Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   \\\"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the   United States, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\\\"    - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the      Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,      97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )  You might rightfully ask \\\"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\\\"  Well, \\\"militia\\\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \\\"militia\\\" as all armed men over the age of 17).     \\\"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time.\\\"  - Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).  The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     \\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason    for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last    resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\\\"      - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776        1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.

Smith, 1787, in        Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).     \\\"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;    as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.

It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian \\\"scientists\\\" would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have \\\"died for a lie\\\".  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the \\\"real thing\\\".    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of a \\\"Therefore...\\\"   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \\\"a is equal to b because a is equal to b\\\".

I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach  Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.    And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know very many homosexuals as it is.    But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to  homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to  stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous  thing.   That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there is also the problem of what has been called \\\"unsanctified mercy.\\\" Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in  this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in  the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have  embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions.     Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus. But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told another not to say good bye to His family.

Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the \\\"well regulated malitia.\\\"  Here is what is says about its character:    To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes   of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through   military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to   acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the   character of a well-regulated militia,   It also talks about the \\\"well regulated militia\\\" having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline.    I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:       Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with  respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed  and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it  will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of  a year.  But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it  requires a continually standing committee of organizers.    Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim a \\\"well regulated militia\\\" is not well organized.  But I will concide  a \\\"well organized militia\\\" is not necessarily a \\\"well regulated militia.\\\"   Several people have stated that the \\\"well organized militia\\\" is what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states   The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied   males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in   section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are,   or who have made a declaration of intention to become,   citizens of the United States and of female citizents of   the United States who are commissioned officers of the   National Guard.  This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \\\"well regulated.\\\" 10 USC 311 does not define a \\\"well regualed militia\\\" in any way, shape,  or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \\\"well regualed militia\\\" as a proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it talk above \\\"disciplining all the militia of the United States\\\" so they fit the \\\"character of a well-regulated militia.\\\"  This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs:   It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor   of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the   present numbers of the people, would not fall far short   of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all   the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the   mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,  would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not   succeed, because it would not long be endured.   Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is: James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \\\"General Welfare\\\" clause):   \\\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first  to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a  recital of particulars.\\\"  So the phrase \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall  not be infringed\\\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \\\"a well  regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\\\"   The definition of \\\"explain\\\" as stated in \\\"The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language\\\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:  1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;     elucidate: \\\"It was the economists who undertook to explain      this puzzle\\\"  2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.  3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:     explain an error The second phrase clearly does not \\\"explain\\\" the first, therefore the second phrase must \\\"qualify\\\" the first.  The definition given for \\\"qualify\\\" is:  1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities     of; characterize.  2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or      task.  3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.  4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.  5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate  6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase) Since \\\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task. By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since #3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \\\"the right  of the people to keep and bear Arms\\\" gives legal power to the \\\"well  regualated militia\\\" and this legal power \\\"shall not be infringed\\\".    I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more  evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the  people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little  about the right of an untrained person to \\\"keep and bear\\\" a .50 caliber machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm (something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me.  -> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy -> our Liberties and Rights.  I mean \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\\\"  Is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what \\\"our Libertues and Rights\\\" are?  I  force my version of \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" by begining statements of what \\\"our Liberties and Rights\\\" with \\\"All that the Second Amendment  clearly states to me.\\\"   Using expressions, such as \\\"states to me,\\\"  clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.  So in effort not to force my views and not \\\"to destory our Liberties and Rights,\\\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in the matter of \\\"Liberties and Rights\\\" is the final word.

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.  Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.\",\"With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is  squeezed out.

Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\"I just got a Quadra 800 8/230 and I've noticed that I can't change the desktop color from the beautiful gray.

This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not compatible.  Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.  (BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)\",\"Hi there,  We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.

Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.

The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.   4) If your answer to 3) above was \\\"the astronomers\\\", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you don't also understand the scoring.\",\"Seth> I fail to see any advantage whatsoever with this kind of set-up.

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.  The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons). For example, in the letter \\\"O\\\" there are two outlines:   1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)  2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.  One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply  connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \\\"polygon with holes\\\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.  I do not want to use this simplistic system since:   1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple   matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for   some fancy fonts).  2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.  From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.  My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons.  Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.

The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However, during this process I have come up with new problems.  1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?\",\"Hello...

A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel  locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is  something that should be avoided.  Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too?

Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in \\\"equivalent time\\\" or in \\\"real time\\\" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope.

These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any  pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to \\\"tell the vision to no  man, until the Son of man be risen again from  the dead\\\" (Matt. 17:9).   If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision  of \\\"paradise\\\" when he \\\"heard unspeakable words,  which it is not lawful for a man to utter\\\" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not  write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by \\\"babes\\\" were  \\\"forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the  multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even  babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from  the world (but it could be something else).   There is much we can discuss about the temple  ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms and other vicarious ordinances for the dead. We can discuss certain concepts regarding the endowment (\\\"the ritual\\\"). However, there are certain elements I can not discuss with anyone (including other saints) outside of the temple. As a portion of the endowment, we receive the tokens and signs that will permit us access to Heaven.

(Around 5 MB.)  I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"From: \\\"dan mckinnon\\\" <dan.mckinnon@canrem.com>      I have lurked here a bit lately, and though some of the math is  unknown to me, found it interesting.

Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.   Certainly a \\\"theoretical structure that makes sense\\\" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Let's face it: we cannot always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \",\"  It's all easy with a DSP.

Paul\",\"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism   Zionism and the Holocaust -------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth  The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.  The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942, its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.  The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe. While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state.  Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political power, power based not on representation, but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to be considered by German Jews.  The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934. Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott. It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out, the campaign would collapse.  This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it offered to collaborate with the new regime:  \\\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build.\\\"  In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott. The main public act was the signature of the \\\"Transfer Agreement\\\" with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine, and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them.  After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS, later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine. This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader, Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.  This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.  In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann, the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.  Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members. Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men, plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions. Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain conditions were met.  The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape, being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership. Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps.  To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews.  There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.  It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration, like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere, did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews.\",\"          \",\" You forgot the smiley-face.

Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.  There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial.

OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't  have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The results:                             RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2: # # # #    Male sex survey: Gay activity low # # # #    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough # #    examination of American men's sexual practices published since # #    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2 # #    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and # #    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual. # # # #    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday # #    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than # #    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional # #    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report. #  # 1) So what?  Homosexuals lie about the 10% number to hide the disproportionate involvement of homosexuals in child molestation.  They also lie about \\\"10%\\\" to keep politicians scared.  # 2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers #    gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of #    us then this is an event unprecidented in history...  But many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals, but other members of the leftist agenda.  # #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. # #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. #  # Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....  Not surprising.  Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.  # #Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson, # #and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that # #homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general # #male population.   #  # And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those # who said they where homosexual? Or is that number to inconvient for # you....  It wasn't published.  # #It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for # #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically # #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. #  # Fuck off  Typical homoseuxal response.   \",\" The VW \\\"Thing\\\" Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and  possibly South America.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\" A freeze dried Tootsie Roll (tm).

A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....  This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc), antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It doesn't \\\"compare\\\" religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began  (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:   I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks. And a can of WD40 helped...  The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm... It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...   Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more (had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden  platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together.  The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine... I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.  Flipped the bottom spring and then...   I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a 1911A1 ...  A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of torque spec ...  It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.   Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a  break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must  have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move  it back... hmmm...).  After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.  BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for. At least it now sits level..  --   E.

We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\"NJ> : >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been  traded,   NJ> : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season?

One is, \\\"We want you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\\\" or the more straightforward, \\\"This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.\\\"         You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.          Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?         And is writing in support of something automatically \\\"propoganda\\\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe?          If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. (In fact, they both were, because the British government had much greater power than did the American system).                 I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), \\\"Congress has become everybody's city council.\\\"         Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.         It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level.          Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \\\"extraordinary\\\" manner.          I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies.           There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos.          Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and  fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?         Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required?         Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not see this as a positive thing.

They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.

There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

On major highways, 3 or more lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C. area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos won't make room.  We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles.

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to \\\"weapon.\\\" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.   It can live in the throat of carriers.

Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some* track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.  I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.  Hope this helps.\",\"  Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see (probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful* You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt. Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.    I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom is that when you move the mouse, it seems to \\\"click\\\" along.

The most recent research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39% of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed., and  57% agreed that \\\"most criminals are more worried  about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\\\"2      One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally, a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion rate  is 36%.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !    I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.  All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than DOS). \",\"Since everyone else seems to be running wild with predictions, I've decided to add my own fuel to the fire: They might seem a bit normal, but there are a few (albeit, small) surprises.

Given the huge problem of underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town.  Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient.  He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to the knees).

Later,\",\" I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim\",\" I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :      The Microlight Solar Sail    -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \\\"If it changes I'll tell you.\\\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS.

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.

The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.  Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664 DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only another component or so.

I'm afraid there's not a bit of religion in macroevolution, and you've made a rather grand statement that Science can not explain origins; to a large extent, it already has! \",\"  Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )     Alex.  \",\" It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by Freeman Dyson et al many years ago. I don't know how well-known this is, but a high explosive Orion prototype flew (in the atmosphere) in San Diego back in 1957 or 1958. I was working at General Atomic at the time, but I didn't learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later, when  Ted Taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done. I feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment, and I'd really like to see it. Has anyone out there seen it?\",\"  You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens  because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country.   No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any \\\"employees\\\" unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough  people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly. If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole kibbutz movement.   This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the  major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular), due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition. In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country (except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.   There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your  disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about.

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered legitimate hypotheses.

So professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with Nystatin, etc., can't very well come into the picture.  Steve doesn't have any patients.     Yes, everyone who is normal does that.  We use candida on the other arm when we put a tuberculin test on.  If people don't react to candida, we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not react to anything.  All normal people have antibodies to candida. If not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.   You've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.

I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): \\\"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.\\\"  (EMPHASIS MINE).\",\"   I HOPE THAT YOU ARE IN THE WAY OF THE NOBLE FEDERAL ENFORCERS and are blown away accidently by the governments goons.

(BTW, as of a couple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail- order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep  them honest about acquiring parts.   For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily. Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are not as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the  plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy, then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it on a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts, more traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.  Mike\",\": : :::Didn't Christ tell his disciples to arm them selves, shortly  :::before his crusifiction?

Any comments?\",\"Archive-name: space/astronaut Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $  HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT      First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA     announcement.      Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \\\"mission     specialist\\\".      If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length. It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight. (DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \\\"you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\\\".      Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance     to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.

Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --     specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum     in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered qualifying:       - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing to:   NASA Johnson Space Center  Astronaut Selection Office  ATTN: AHX  Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.

Why do I think this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987), their line made so much sense -- only people who \\\"need\\\" guns should be able to get them, and the people who \\\"need\\\" them are the police and other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me, folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other \\\"legitimate\\\" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they can't protect you).   Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but explaining exactly how an \\\"evil\\\" semiautomatic weapon really works does wonders).  I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the oppressed and the terrorized.\",\"  Perhaps we ought not to have supported a known genocidist?

As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(  There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G  The second bank is labeled \\\"IRQ\\\" and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S  I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the \\\"G\\\" enables the game port and the \\\"S2\\\" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!  EBD --  Elliot Dierksen   \\\"Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or                    is that a Sears  poncho?

To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.

Probably got a real gut-buster going when the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago, huh?  Of course, in Britain, your government has ordered you defenseless, so your way of coping with violent criminals is to laugh at victims.   I don't know about a .45.  My own preference is for 9mm.   Ah, Canada.  Where the criminals don't bother with checking to see if the victims are home.  They just break on in.  America's a little different, you see.  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot, so they more frequently check to see if anyone's home.   I've heard Gun World in Phoenix, Arizona, is fantastic!  I'm hoping to visit there myself soon.   Ah, Britain again.  Isn't that the place where you're guilty until proven innocent?  Tell me, Mr. \\\"jaj@vax.oxford.ac.uk\\\" didn't Britain come begging to us \\\"gun nut morons\\\" in the early 1940s for guns to defend yourselves against Hitler?  Seems as though your supposedly  enlightened government had disarmed you: \\\"Aw chaps, you can jolly give up your guns.  If that Hitler man starts to threaten, we can  always hit up the Yanks for a few guns.  They've got a bloody eccentric habit about those guns, you know.  Just hand in your shotgun, that's it.  Thank you.\\\"    Ain't it just amazing how those black markets work?  Damn if those drugs from south america keep coming over our borders, too, even though we've banned them.  Guess we might as well legalize them.   Makes you want to send fifty bucks to the Libertarian Party just thinking about it, doesn't it?   Your close-minded ignorance is without parallel.  I guess that's what happens when you're raised as a \\\"subject\\\" without rights.  Your type gravitates to those who desire to hold power over you.   Just chuckle as the cops beat you senseless to get a confession. Just laugh yourself silly when you find that confession is valid in court.  \\\"Hey mate, this is justice, British style.\\\"   Drew \",\"   I think that you are changing the meaning of \\\"values\\\" here. Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.  value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in  usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus.  The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound.   In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing.  In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the word \\\"value\\\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as \\\"objective values.\\\"  Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow. Just because the word \\\"values\\\" is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts.  If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  So, back to the original question:  And objective morality is.....?  If you can provide an objective foundation for \\\"morality\\\" then that will be a good beginning. \",\"Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most accurate translation? \",\" Wow! A 68070! I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these, especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the 68060, which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-D\",\"The term \\\"stopper\\\" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak.   The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.   What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.    Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have slowed down a step.  That's scary.  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going for him.\",\" The most practical use I've seen for them is as key ring ornaments :-)\",\"[For those attending the AAAI conf this summer, note that this conference is immediately preceding it.]            PRELIMINARY PROGRAM AND REGISTRATION MATERIALS                First International Conference on           Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology                         Washington, D.C.

Indurkhya                        TUTORIAL PROGRAM Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on  Tuesday, July 6.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer   Scientists\\\"  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)  This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is  intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists  who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.   Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the \\\"central dogma\\\" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology.  12:00-2:45pm \\\"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for   Biologists\\\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory   in Biological Sequence Analysis\\\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\\\"   Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field.  3:00-5:45pm \\\"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\\\"   Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.\",\" There's a program called \\\"Icon Frightener\\\" included with the book Stupid Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel (Addison-Wesley, 1992).

The state was Virginia, and the law passed.   That right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not a criminal, and I don't indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.   So please explain how I am \\\"inflicting\\\" anything on other people.   \",\"  My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.    Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala dispensationalism. \",\"Archive-name: rec-autos/part1  [most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]                 === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===  This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put \\\"ny,nj\\\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.

We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.    From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \\\"Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back.\\\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't \\\"get away\\\" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.

It uses few calculations however, basically it is several comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.    Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise  rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well expect the sucker to last 300k miles.   Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not pleasant.

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support for an \\\"assault weapon\\\" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.  Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (\\\"Seduction of the Gun\\\") that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back- page ad for a \\\"Terminator II\\\" video game extolling the numerous and varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.  Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a concealed handgun.

After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction  will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST* 25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of padding).   All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit,  so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing  items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask. * Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as most of the material inside is in great shape. Excellent - IE-\\\"As you find them in the store\\\" Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten Good      - On down the line Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still \\\"decent\\\") Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by scissors).   A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is  missing (usually the insert) I'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until the bidding stops) * Again if you have any questions, ask away. * arrow      $2.50 056 - Fair     *- Top secret module missing - Bard tunes -  real maps TN.DE7     $3.0  073 - Good      - Forest of Doom module (detached but  included) - inner planes ykchev     $1.75 074 - Good     *- Combat computer missing - 4 dragons  TN.DE7     $1.50 078 - Good/VG   - Monsters - aquatic AD&D module (detached  but included) - Language lesson geoffrey   $1.50 079 - Good/VG   - top secret module (detached but  included) - magic resistance mayla      $2.50 081 - Fair      - High level AD&D module (detached but  included) - poison - material spell components UCCXKVB    $2.00 082 - Very Fair*- Baton races game insert missing - spell  research TN.DE7     $1.50 083 - Good/VG   - Babba Yagga's Hut module (detached but  included) - unarmed combat geoffrey   $1.50 084 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Twofold talisman module squidly    $1.75 085 - Good      - Twofold Talisman module - Clerics squidly    $1.75 087 - Good      - Top secret module - Wildernes geoffrey   $1.50 088 - Good     *- Elefant Hunt insert missing - Falling  damage - MARVEL-Phile geoffrey   $1.50 089 - Good     *- Creature catalog missing - Shields - sci fi TN.DE7     $1.5  094 - Good      - Ranger changes - Creature catalog II  (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 095 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Into the Forgotten Realms  module, detached but included ykcheu     $2.75 098 - Fair      - 9th anniversary - Dragons - mutant manual UCCXKVB    $1.75 099 - Poor     *- Cover Missing - Treasure trove II, some  pictures cut out thedm      $2.50 100 - Good     *- poster missing - city beyond the gate  module (detached but included) - \\\"raised dragon\\\" texture on cover geoffrey   $1.50 101 - Fair     *- Cover missing - creature catalog III  (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 102 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Valley of earth mother  middle level module (detached but included) geoffrey   $1.50 103 - Fair     *- Cover loosly attached - Unearth arcana  update missing - Future of AD&D - Centaur papers geoffrey   $1.50 103 - Fair     *- Unearth arcana update missing  geoffrey   $1.50 104 - Fair/VF   - Marvel module - thieves - cover detached  but included                                                                  geoffrey   $1.50 105 - Fair      - AD&D module - invisibility - cover & back  cover detached but included       UCCXKVB    $2.00 106 - Fair      - Cover 1/2 on - variations of paladins -  more skills 4 rangers ykcheu     $2.75 106 - Good/VG   - Variations of paladins - more skills for  rangers     arrow      $2.50 107 - Fair     *- Cover missing - Dragons of glory  supplement/questionaire geoffrey   $1.50 108 - Good      - Mutant manual II - environmental  effects - cover taped reinforced thedm      $2.00 108 - Very Good - Mutant manual II - environmental effects  ykcheu     $2.25 109 - Good      - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster geoffrey   $1.50 109 - Very Fair - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster  missing geoffrey   $1.50 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv squidly    $1.75 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv geoffrey   $1.50 111 - Good      - Murder Mystery AD&D module ykcheu     $2.50 112 - Very Good - Ultimate Article Index - Mesozoic monsters mayla      $2.50 114 - Very Fair - Elven Cavalier - remorhaz - Witch NPC class ykcheu     $1.75 115 - Good      - Theives - harpies & snakes squidly    $1.75 116 - Good/VG   - 3-D ship cardboard insert - wild  animals - dr who UCCXKVB    $2.50 117 - Good/VG   - Dice odds - creative campaigns - sage  advice - bazaar geoffrey   $1.50 118 - Good      - Tournaments/Competitions - Nibar's keep game UCCXKVB    $2.00 120 - VG/EX     - April fool's issue UCCXKVB    $2.00 121 - Excellent - Oriental adventures - cardboard castle  insert geoffrey   $1.50 122 - Excellent - 11th aniversary - African beasts - druids UCCXKVB    $2.50 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry thedm      $2.25 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry arrow      $2.5  124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire UCCXKVB    $2.25 124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire geoffrey   $1.50 125 - Very Good - Clay-O-Rama!

Just wondering. I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also, many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions.   Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day.  If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore.   Thanks for your time.

(The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a \\\"foreign\\\" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the body evicts the \\\"intruder\\\", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.      We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies.      Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this? Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)\",\"Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can convert a .GIF image into a .BMP image suitable for a Windows  wallpaper (i.e. 256 colors).

This made such long-term usage of  oil practical.  Isn't the Discovery channel great!?! \",\"  Well, I've said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is objectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.  Without omniscience, an objective system is not possible in practice.\",\"==========================                                OZONE GIF IMAGES                                 April 15, 1993                          ==========================       Two GIF images of the ozone maps over the northern and southern hemispheres are now available at the JPL Info public access site.

I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is  still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe. The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon, flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre. There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.   The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these, then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least 3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent  reports of the existence of any diversion structure there. Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells. It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate  (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should  agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on \\\"regional issues\\\".  The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

Later,\",\": In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a : reach. Science has its basis in observable fact.   I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first.  WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the \\\"Default\\\" location for the printers instead of \\\"Tractor\\\" or \\\"Manual\\\".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.  MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm not.  Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.  WORKAROUND ---------- Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizen printer driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.

That is, ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry, and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?    A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways?\",\"Mr. Freeman:  Please find something more constructive to do with your time rather than engaging in fantasy.....

So, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a whole room of them?  A whole nation?   Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.

Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.   Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think that it is applicable to them.

That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.   So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly. I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.   I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency.   Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...

The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7, then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip, thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.       Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused!.\",\"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"  What evidence are you aware of.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"   Bobby:    Get this the hell out of your .sig until you 1) learn what it   stands for and 2) really mean it.  /\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\   Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM   They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.\",\"Source: \\\"World Alive, A Personal Story\\\" by Robert Dunn.

I think both shots would have traveled 500 feet.\",\"  I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.   I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.     I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.   While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!   I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.   But I'm digressing....     God be with you,\",\" I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question \\\"What temperature does water boil at?\\\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told \\\"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.\\\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.    Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \\\"blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks\\\" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.     I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be  able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another. The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I know I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.        There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.        Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few         adults respond to this treatment.

I noted that Protestants do not consider Sunday worship a law.  --clh]  He was not referring to the FAQ but to the five Sabbath Admissions posted on the bible study group.  This is what prompted someone to send the FAQ to me.  n> ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  You cannot show, from scripture, that the weekly Sabbath is part of the ceremonial laws.   Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  Can the churches also decide what is and is not sin?  Interesting.

There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.  'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.  This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches and cheap booklets about some church ....  And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert  everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?

You lurkers can join in at any time, you know!  Ahhh.. Talk.politics.guns -- the kindler, gentler newsgroup.  Who would have thought?    I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user. Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it.    I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    That seems to be the case already, given that heavy weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks, whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large, though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise, I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers.    I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons, fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support.  Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry. I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble. I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in. I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    So would I, but the resources often aren't available to outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else.    Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.   Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly, hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally, the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias for these functions.\",\"As quoted from <1993Apr5.172734.8744@icd.ab.com> by kdw@icd.ab.com (Kenneth D.

Please help since my mechanic and me are clueless!...\",\"nan\",\"  It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at the Aud -- last year's Bruins-Sabres game.  I knew all about the Detroit version, but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling.  :-) \",\"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:  [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users  took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the  constellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities  on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.
