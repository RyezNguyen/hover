Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany, Japan and many other \\\"industrial rivals\\\" more than these two.

There is only one way of determin- ing \\\"best\\\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the \\\"best\\\" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of \\\"best\\\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.   Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.   You don't have to be rude.   For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  -- \",\" Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two  small children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive  conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their  could have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible  studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding  faith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY*  whose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and  unsuspecting masses?

We will grant that a God exists, and uses revelation to communicate with humans. (Said revelation taking the form (paraphrased from your own words) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck, makes him take dictation, and then hides away for a few hundred years'.)  Now, there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation. This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world (which is all this person has ever seen), but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation.   Now, based on this, can this person be blamed for concluding, absent a personal revelation of their own, that there is almost certainly nothing to this 'revelation' thing?    Absent this better language, and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation, can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing?   Here is what I am driving at: I have thought a long time about this. I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity, it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with.  Now, if there does happen to be, say, a Christian God, will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake?

Around a million Americans every year defend themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the deterrent that is needed.  I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns should be banned by the Klintonistas.   Statistics, por favor?   See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.   People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still* have the right to keep and bear arms.

This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the \\\"Annunciation\\\" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28   And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\\\"Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women.\\\"_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - \\\"the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women\\\" - while you read on....  In the book, \\\"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary\\\" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \\\"The Conception of Saint Anne\\\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber \\\"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body\\\"; she is \\\"God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\\\"  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as \\\"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\\\". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From \\\"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\\\" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: \\\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women\\\".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart. \",\"   I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest assured that the street prices for the MX-3 and Escort and (maybe) even the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about.

(random access memory boards for Apple Macintosh PowerBook Duos)  MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.  COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993  By Raines Cohen       Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss and other problems.       Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify. Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.       > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to wake from sleep.       Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed while the Duo sleeps.       > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.       Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is compatible with the slower chips.       > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally when in a Duo Dock.\",\"Hi there,   I am looking for advice on software/hardware package for making,  storing and processing of pictures.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\"  (Deletion)  \",\" <Moral Driver distinctions deleted>   Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge and an \\\"object\\\". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \\\"what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\\\". I think I need some more time with this one.  That's about it for now!

I don't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.

That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans, who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone comes to me and says, \\\"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\\\", then I would have to say, \\\"you are a murderer of your own blood because if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood\\\".    Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940 [\\\"Trials of Wa Criminals\\\", Vol. IV, p. 1140] ------------------------------------------------------------------ If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides, provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this kind is out of the question.  The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp. This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all - we all know that - but we need them.  \",\"-*---- I think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a definition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly and that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition is this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous   Unless one classifies \\\"thinking and informal exploration\\\" as a mistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would consider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as unscientific.     Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what \\\"science is mainly about.\\\"  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are \\\"mainly about.\\\"  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.   I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about \\\"absolute scientific truth.\\\"  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers' minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generation's Rhine.   I think this is absurd.     I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases one's defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

CONTROLLER VS9         The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.        VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from        a field of 724x600 pixels.        The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in        the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal        and vertical directions.        The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.        Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                       CONTROLLER VS52         The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM        PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was        created on the base of modern elements, including user        programmable gate arrays.        The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different        resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change        technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning        devices).        The controller has the following technical characteristics:        - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64        to 1024x512 pixels ;        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024        pixels;        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024        pixels ;        - number of gray level - 256 ;        - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;        - 4 input video multiplexer ;        - input/output lookup table (LUT);        - possibility to realize \\\"scroll\\\" and \\\"zoom\\\";                     - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external        controlling signal) ;        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -        digital converter;        - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.

No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever.

I'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything, substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem.  The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled \\\"Hello Again, Mary Jane\\\" which appears in the current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).      Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing     smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \\\"Perhaps     because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby     is out in full force,\\\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug     Enforcement Administration.  \\\"The fact is, they're losing the     battle.\\\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said     they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner     says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that     studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of     nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.  The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993 issue of USA Today (\\\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\\\" by Mike Snider, p. 6D).      Adolescents' choices      Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:                       Estimated, per 100 students                              1991     1992   Pct. chg.

I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics--- only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public.  Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution). Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore, if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all* the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \\\"war on drugs\\\" is being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants, then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective.  For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.  The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program. The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.  IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out.  They are as follows:      * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which       states the possible health hazzards involved with using this       product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.       Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used       ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.      * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of       revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs       through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from       drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law       enforcement.      * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of       18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the       taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.       Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning       information should also be a felony.      * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the       purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This       agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad       drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.  I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW, I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths--- something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

Later, they went on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.

So, what do you think is the \\\"meaning behind\\\",   the intention and the effect when an \\\"army\\\" purposely   *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look   like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will   receive from this \\\"cover\\\" is more important that the harm  that will come to civilians.*  This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians in \\\"the middle\\\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians.   But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves  at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \\\"why set   ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made   cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of   view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept   some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.   I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that \\\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\\\" will do more to stop attacks.   As I said previously, Israel spent several decades \\\"sitting passively\\\" on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after* the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well. The \\\"host\\\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path.    This is just another \\\"selectively applied\\\" statement.   The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.  That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for  the \\\"interim\\\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are demanding conditions that essentially define \\\"autonomy\\\" already. They DO NOT trust that Israel will \\\"follow through\\\" the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy.   Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians?  If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians  be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words? Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up \\\"tangible assets  (land, control of areas) in exchange for \\\"words\\\". For this reason, they are also concerned about the sorts of \\\"guarantees\\\" they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis \\\"word\\\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party finally gets HOLD of this \\\"land\\\", what the \\\"other party\\\" does is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land, your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back.   While the \\\"major armaments\\\" (those allowing people to wage \\\"civil wars\\\") have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \\\"commando\\\" raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.   Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks were commonplace.   There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \\\"disarmed\\\" UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.  That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to \\\"take over\\\" Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that. What both \\\"sides\\\" need is to receive something \\\"tangible\\\". The Arabs/ Palestinians are looking for \\\"land\\\" and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks\",\"  Well said Mr. Beyer :) \",\" When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.

I mean, I know it's the Net and all, but the prankster didn't even have Clinton's sound-bites right.  \",\" The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   \\\"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.\\\"                       - G.

It is     disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich    or any other act of terrorism or mrder.

It is NOT a \\\"terrorist camp\\\" as you and the Israelis like     to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer    in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....  I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \\\"terrorist camps\\\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion.      SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of    the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not     know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often    suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are    supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and    ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps    for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured    by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages    of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they    are back they announce that they bombed a \\\"terrorist  hideout\\\" where    an 8 year old girl just happened to be.  Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area, backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation, while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing, which would have produced major casualties.     Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that    we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance    on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING     ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real     leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.  Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks.     This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to    realize that the concept of a \\\"buffer zone\\\" aimed at protecting    its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more    Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel    would have resulted in.    Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though.     There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese    goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such     circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is    capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did    in all other parts of Lebanon.  No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.     I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing    CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.  No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation. \",\": : 42 is 101010 binary, and who would forget that its the : : answer to the Question of \\\"Life, the Universe, and Everything else.\\\" : : Of course the Question has not yet been discovered... : ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : But it WAS discovered (sort of).

Fuel injector  cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has.

The NEC Adapter does not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.  Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??  The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);   Macintosh LC to VGA   The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to 16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported to 256 colors.   Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level           inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work           with the Macintosh LC.   To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the pinout description for the adapter cable:   Macintosh LC        VGA Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name ---------------     ----    ----------- 1                   6       Red ground 2                   1       Red video signal 5                   2       Green video signal 6                   7       Green ground 9                   3       Blue video signal 13                  8       Blue ground 15                  13      /HSYNC 12                  14      /VSYNC 14                  10      HSYNC ground 7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together   VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC video connector.

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.

On BOTH cars, the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come off easily.

Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)  The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately, System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.   Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it.  Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs.  Any better suggestions?

If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from  the police and to be a member of a gun-club.

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.

Nobody can listen in--except the feds.      Hey, it's better than the status quo.     I am far less worried about \\\"the feds\\\" tapping my phone than high school     scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and     cordless phone calls.  I'm a political dissident. I'm scared shitless of the feds listening in on my calls. My opinions are the sort that would get me \\\"disappeared\\\" in a slightly less free society -- and who knows what sort of society we will be in in five or ten years? I have friends who have had their phones tapped -- none of this is theoretical to me.  As for \\\"its better than the status quo\\\", well, first of all, you can get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work well. In addition, a number of groups are now working on building software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now -- and they are all working in overdrive mode.     And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at     least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...  There ARE no crypto restrictions... yet. You can use anything you want RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\" I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address. The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons) agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.  I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident). There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.   As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty (or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing, figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come those consulted could be roughly described as \\\"us insiders\\\"?  They cannot quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone. Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust, past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely' or 'difficult'.   So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor, easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge, would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.  This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights, that \\\"puts people first\\\".  The question is \\\"put people first\\\" to WHERE?  With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY. Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?  And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance! I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice :-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...   What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda. It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the argumet \\\"well, if you got nothing to hide...\\\"  Fine. Then using that argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.  Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.   People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years, because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.  If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there... :-)  And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...  Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure but \\\"good enough\\\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full description (not a PR non-statement) of just what \\\"good enough\\\" means? I think when saying how strong it is, \\\"good enough\\\" really means \\\"not very\\\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \\\"too many rights and safeguards\\\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having \\\"too many rights\\\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime, etc).  BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution.  It has to stop.

The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \\\"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\\\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \\\"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\\\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \\\"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\\\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \\\"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\\\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \\\"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \\\"with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even\\\"] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way.\\\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: \\\"In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise.\\\" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: \\\"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?\\\" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: \\\"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture.\\\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: \\\"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\\\" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: \\\"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\\\" (Page 331.)

After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

The symposium is intended for those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, rather than in theory.  Symposium proceedings will be published by the Internet Society.  Topics for the symposium include, but are not limited to, the following:  *  Design and implementation of services--access control, authentication,    availability, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation    --including criteria for placing services at particular protocol layers.  *  Design and implementation of security mechanisms and support    services--encipherment and key management systems, authorization    and audit systems, and intrusion detection systems.  *  Requirements and architectures for distributed applications and    network functions--message handling, file transport, remote    file access, directories, time synchronization, interactive    sessions, remote data base management and access, routing, voice and    video multicast and conferencing, news groups, network management,    boot services, mobile computing, and remote I/O.  *  Special issues and problems in security architecture, such as    -- very large systems like the international Internet, and    -- high-speed systems like the gigabit testbeds now being built.  *  Interplay between security goals and other goals--efficiency,    reliability, interoperability, resource sharing, and low cost.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that \\\"different is good\\\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \\\"propriatory nature\\\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.   The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).     All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.   I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).   I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \\\"Highway Patrolman\\\".   Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.\",\"  The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we should.  \",\"I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of  Christ's resurrection.    First the scriptural quotations:  This sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified, if not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most of these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would try to justify their own positions.  Second the logical proof:    The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief without logical proof.

Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign.

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level. \",\" : >EVER HEAR OF : >BAPTISM AT BIRTH?

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it \\\"infallibilism\\\".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.\",\"    On my 486DX33 with the Stealth 24 VLB I get 11.4 WinMarks with ver. 3.11           \",\"Are there any Honda groups out there?

The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.

By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.  A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.

Neil Smith                     LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE  [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \\\"Adrian\\\" -- name changed to protect the guilty --  and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with  the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]  Dear Adrian:    I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to  your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and  generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist  mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back  with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present  now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the  future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.    There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger  of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.  10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,  shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic  rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll  limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent  with your note.    First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Second, publication of some latter-day \\\"scientific study\\\" doesn't  alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my  interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.    Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Fourth, as often happens with these things, the \\\"study\\\" doesn't  support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions  anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older  body of lies, omissions, and distortions.    Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on  countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this  present \\\"study\\\" dubious, to say the least.    Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat  (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you  should be better aware than most people how \\\"progress\\\" -- in  designing \\\"studies\\\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our  ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree  on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30  years to create \\\"studies\\\" \\\"proving\\\" that pornography causes crime.   More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s  clearly indicate the contrary.    Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Tenth, another reason to doubt all such \\\"studies\\\" is that human  behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The  attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the  resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.    Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is  a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,  and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic  process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    Twelfth, the \\\"study\\\" is also worthless because it incorporates  figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but  basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social  benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a  criminal offense.    Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials  quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are  many), are correct in this instance:  the \\\"study\\\" is meaningless  because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a  natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and  Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process  nor to arguments grounded in social utility.    And because of that, Adrian, even if the \\\"study\\\" were valid, it  wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that  anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,  whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's  permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists  themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed  people to go out and buy their first gun \\\"while they still can\\\".   Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \\\"shooting fraternity\\\"  viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,  ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in  the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,  and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we  probably manufacture at least that many every year.  The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly  aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what  their real motives are.    Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,  it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;  the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the  self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing  this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a  quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \\\"half life\\\"  of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna  be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.  As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law  provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I  will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is  that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands  -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can  only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given  both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics  and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.  \\\"We are giving a positive response to all requests\\\" from Azerbaijan, \\\"within the limits of our capabilities,\\\" he said.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework  of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.  Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.  Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians. \\\"We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that) help may take in the future,\\\" he said.  He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, \\\"and the whole world knows about it.\\\"  Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be  based on street-level excitement, he said.  There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and  helicopters.  The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has  occurred, the sources said.  The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.  \",\"   Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\",\"If the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called 'Karla', the next one  should be called 'Smiley'.\",\"   backdesk.zip is on CICA, but I'm not sure of the whole directory.

I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1 on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of the interrupts in between. Works just great.    If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.    It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the   first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response --  especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no problems.

God's laws were originally written for  the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus.  If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin. They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it.    I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?  Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will. Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

I have come across a few that look good:    Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an  attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history.  It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian  dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst  ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable  of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian  genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.  People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were  killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there  are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place,  despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been  well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role   in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,   Freiburg (1980).    page 19:   <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to   reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil   among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if   the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the   fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which   Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the   Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the   realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution   in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews   fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that   the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that   there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and   eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the   effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and   persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection   of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,   was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>     page 21:    <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official   in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi   Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and   the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation   of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from   Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two   recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom   of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European   coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.   This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant   conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of   travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who   would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)     page 41:   <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were  firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them  and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians  of Europe.   Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is  also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews  as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.  Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians  representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European  sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition  it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their  sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who  regularly reported to the Ottomans.   There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans  in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances  of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited  instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the  early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy  for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman  document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some  Greek towns...>>   page 43:    <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally  accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,  and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of  the situation.>>    page 46:   <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not  particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common  interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition  which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If  there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between  religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was  that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with  the Orthodox.>>   page 46:   <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context  during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of  interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed  Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already  existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish  response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian  countries to Ottoman domains.>>   page 151:    <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the   Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would   characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,   in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and   the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions   elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the   Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>    page 161:    <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success   of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success   in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both   cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough   to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success   without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve   the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear   that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable   partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.   We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their   success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the   Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries   the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>   (*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:    page 32:    <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles   and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear   the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly   oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and   prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob   and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They   wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will   give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German   rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,   which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest   and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you   who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with   in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out   to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain   of.

Everything is cheap, and every one of us   lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow   hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and   great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy   among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him   to rob him of his gold.

The Jewish      Center of Culture in the Ottoman Empire (Hebrew Union College Press,      Ktav Publishers, New York, 1974).  Serdar Argic\",\" There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic.  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a \\\"friend of a friend\\\" thing.

Hmm . . . Could it be that we're dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? Dare I say it, a BAT-SQUID?? (huh? Bat-Squid?) It all adds up now . . .  Let's make the B-man an honorary DoD DuDe. All he needs is a DoD sticker.  Actually, anyone have an address for Batman's current artists, both comic book and animated series? We'll write and ask if Batman would like to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!  Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary member with an imaginary motorcycle? Having seen the computers in the Bat-Cave, I think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary Internet access.

Frank\",\"I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.  Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :   typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:   (*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)  Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.  Many thanks in advance for any help. \",\"Could some kind soul please email ma a response since i don't have much time to read this group.

This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe \\\"orbital\\\" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!     1   I dream like this: ether based reality     The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = \\\"dark matter\\\")    The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its \\\"foot print\\\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is  itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \\\"orbit\\\" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \\\"distance\\\"  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the \\\"path\\\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \\\"j\\\" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as \\\"earth's\\\" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?     O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S  E       /     \\\\                 M    |      |      OR                M              \\\\ _ _ /                                 S                                      The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \\\"turntable view\\\"  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that \\\"earth shadow.\\\") Its only the moon's image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    \\\"Light-Years\\\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The \\\"piece\\\" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machine's receiver next to it.      If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT  PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what  they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  \\\"advising\\\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve  souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was  finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it  seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.     MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls  whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)    Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a  Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go  ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.  I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with  every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:  Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \\\"its chaos!\\\" They  said, \\\"no, its order.\\\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy  would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and  pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably  naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should  be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.  They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers  might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a  different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.    Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a  huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat  only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and  need a lot less sleep.    UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The  troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill  each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)    Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot  tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they  suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that  they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.     Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women  and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut  from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think  that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as  mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples  of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.    That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He  tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which  the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll  play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll  whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to  live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was  right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go  back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over  your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality  in which you don't want to be a part of. \",\"/(Frank DeCenso) /> />I need to prioritize things in my life, and this board is not all that important />to me.

Normally, the older boards have a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.    If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

Having found some files (public) to look into, I ftp'ed them to a system I have access to.  I then used kermit to transmit them via modem to my host computer, a PC-based file system.  I access internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error in the tar process about directories being invalid. What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed, binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  My guess is that it is the copy to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have large, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get them :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the waist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's problems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and when I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).  I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks.  Also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands. I've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my sidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight), stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit), and run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be running errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...  As far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably equal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.  So I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit, I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.

Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit. It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish. Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent, usually state, regulations remain in some instances.

I'am arguing about  : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?   It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,  while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the  cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by  this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of  extermination of the Jews.  This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \\\"encore\\\" performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.  Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who could be expected to oppose their plans.   On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even  though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over 60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.   Rawlinson wired to his superiors,   \\\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control,  atrocities were constantly being committed.\\\"    Come again?  : \\\"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...

It's not fully up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different manufacturer's synonyms):  ------ In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility):  74 The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.  74H Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.  74L Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  Very obsolete; use CMOS.  74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.  74LS Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  devices.  74F Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.  74AS Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  CMOS 74 families.  4000 (Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K (Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  can be expensive.  100K (For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.\",\"    The docs say that it's a SCSI Manager bug, if this changes things at all...\",\" First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about \\\"You sick perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.\\\", which seems to be the usual \\\"religious\\\" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't get flamed, either.  You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground.  First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \\\"objective morality\\\".  Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.   Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say, you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.    Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring, overbearing totalitarianists?    Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered.  The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                              (Evidence deleted)  I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \\\"The Word of God\\\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs.  Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.   Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?                                                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     not very objective.    One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \\\"more good\\\" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is not necessarily true.                                           ^^^^       Might I suggest the word \\\"penis\\\"? It seems more in line with the tone of your post.              Bravo!  I respect you and your sense of humor, sir.                                                     Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However, they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf Sternberg, for example.   It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the character) has orgasmed.                         Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your church.           In addition, if sex is for procreation, then  1) Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it, rather than building it in as instinct? 2) Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?     Granted.   Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

My comments are based primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \\\"The Trinitarian Controversy\\\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the \\\"Apologists\\\".  Their theology has often been described as \\\"Logos theology\\\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This \\\"immanent Word\\\" became \\\"expressed\\\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the \\\"economy\\\").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should probably be called \\\"economic trinitarianism\\\", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism   Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end.  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism   Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting \\\"three in oneness\\\" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [I've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  \\\"Economic\\\" Trinitarianism   Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various \\\"neo-economic\\\" Trinitarians Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as \\\"distinction\\\" and \\\"distribution\\\" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \\\"eternally generated\\\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that \\\"there was once when he was not\\\" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate \\\"hypostases\\\", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (\\\"of the same substance\\\").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]   Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \\\"Threeness in oneness\\\" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality:  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence.  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox Trinitarianism   Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \\\"undivided in divided persons.\\\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of \\\"three in oneness.\\\" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H. Wayne House.   Frank\",\": >I want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying Adcom seperates. : >I have heard from alot of people, though, that Adcom sounds great but : >that the components are made cheaply and therefore won't last very long. : >The time estimates I've heard are like only 3 or 4 years.  Is this true?  I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no   amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.  If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will   sound brilliant and last a long time - period.  Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps. \",\"The last state church was in Massachusetts.

Does anyone know of such statistics availability and an idea of the cost?\",\"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6  [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)   school-request:   welty school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school: \\\"|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school\\\" owner-school: school-request owner-school-out: school-request   here's what is going on here:  the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as follows:  ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\\\         (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\\          cat -) | \\\\         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\\                 -F \\\"The ${1} Mailing List\\\" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming message, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to: 99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.  For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.

However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L.

In that posting I made sure I used the word \\\"public\\\".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\",\"I have an addition to the FAQ regarding \\\"why are there no atheist hospitals.\\\"  If I recall correctly, Johns Hopkins was built to provide medical services without the \\\"backing\\\" of a religious group...thus making it a hospital \\\"dedicated to the glory of [weak] atheism.\\\"  Might someone check up on this? \",\"         I own a new ford Explorer, I really love it!

Apparently, that's not the case with virginia.edu, since you are still posting.\",\" Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be like without Recchi for 30 games.  Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.  Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.  My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.\",\"If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created.  Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed.  Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.  Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with \\\"blue box\\\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones, we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments.  Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days, a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.  In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and persistent threat to the general public.  On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.  Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments, there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered, and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.\",\"Okay all my friends are bitching at me that the map I made in Appsoft Draw can't be displayed in \\\"xv\\\"...

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.  For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.

Au contraire; he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy Campanella.      Which reports are those?      I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter. Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem.       I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.     As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have.

This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches...   Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information or opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.  I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them.

TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use, by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include advice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to   warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.  Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening. These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your  body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.        Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)     Available from:  Bright Star  Tel: +1 (206) 451 3697     Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows     Description:  Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info.   Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations  on posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best   with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible  to record your own messages to warn of break.       Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)     Available from:  Media Vision  Tel: +1 (510) 226 2563     Platforms: PC     Description:  A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.

El Camino Real  Suite 109  Mailstop 403  Sunnyvale, CA  Tel: +1 (408) 730 8410     Platforms: DOS     Description:  Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take  breaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or  after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.  It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from  a set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work  you do - data entry, word processing, information processing.  Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on  how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.   CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use   to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information  on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.  A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.   CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then  warn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear  useful when used with Windows.

The stretches work  all parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent  Repetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve  your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these  help you to become more relaxed and productive.\\\"    \\\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.  Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup  for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to  promote healthy and efficient computer use.     Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts  for resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).       Comments:  I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say  it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it  does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it  interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which  is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on  Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure  why. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has  one window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not  require any sound hardware.      Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)     Available from:  Visionary Software  P.O.

Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does   have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,  which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.      Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)     Available from:  Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar     Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)     Description:  This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you  to stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously  typing.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check  that you really do take a break, and tells you when you  can start typing again.     Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing  today, each time it warns you, which is useful so you  know how much you *really* type.  It also logs information  to a file that you can analyse or simply print out.     The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),  in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message  (for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu>   has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for   X, Zephyr and Mach.   Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk  (for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,  X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give   feedback.      Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs     Available from:  Various sources     Platforms: Various     Description:  Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming  appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.  Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit  a program to run at a specific time to display a message to  the screen.   Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and  include this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so  you get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you  want to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.  Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter  9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break  is for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat   for the next appointment.   By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes  that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this  file on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with  a single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments  with RSI exercises.   The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs.   An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job  that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will  depend a lot on your operating system.   While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing   yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI   management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to  write a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating  system, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.      Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers     Available from:  Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.     Description:  Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable  number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either  manually or automatically.     While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you  are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from  a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great  advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you  are doing.       Comments:  My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to  my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which  actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left  arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been  very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.   I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but  these are not much good because they do not give an audible  warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.   One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how  you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing, and may therefore make matters worse.      Tool: hsh (public domain)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar     Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)     Description:  Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.  Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or  an xterm, but not most X programs).      Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)     Available from:  Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c  Also built into Windows 3.x.      Description:  The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout  that involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent  RSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since   it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)   \",\"How we survived ww2: We mailed postings about things we didn't know any thing about to ONLY the wrong places.

(although the Internet comes close.)\",\" No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court. Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones, record calls without listening to them, and then post-facto obtain warrants and listen to calls after probable cause is established.  But this strategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not in the near term.)  In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence inadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to interpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprised that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything but analogous to a wiretap by the courts.  Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technically feasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now without warrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future, start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause, decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation gets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.  While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this archiving scenario to extremes, read \\\"Lacey and his Friends\\\", a collection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the slippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it's stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can get to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all major streets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and teller machines, don't we?  And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public places.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime ever to be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy cubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and after.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven't curtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'd be to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.  And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.  After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...  Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry became pretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate all crime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on grounds of national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for their execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of competition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.   I can't imagine why. \",\"Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on: Is there such a thing as a 'justifible' war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \\\"All war   is wrong\\\", or \\\"Some war is justifiable\\\".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a   pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War  - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.  - Massive civilian casualties on both sides    - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki  - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war  - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically    communism vs. capitalism.  - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam  - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.  - Genocide by Khmer Rouge.  - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm)  - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply  - Other factors such as genocide.  - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia  - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'  - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.  - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel.  - My feelings in this are simple  - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent  - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear    armed or powered warships from NZ port.  - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I   would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I   *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

Technical issues are not terribly important at this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a \\\"full page\\\" monitor for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember, technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \\\"full\\\" height.  The screen would probably be monochrome. The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Like many politicians he cared      Less about ideals          than results      Less about ends          than means      Less about anything          than keeping his job               (and his head).  We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose      conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him,   See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.  If he killed their madman     He'd start a riot          and lose his job              (and his head)  If he saved the King of the Jews     He'd piss off Caesar          and lose his job              (and his head)  And when his wife told him to have    Nothing to do with the righteous lout She didn't tell him anything    He hadn't already figured out.

His ass is covered---if Herod has no problem, Caesar certainly won't.  The fool can be king of whatever world he wants as long as it's not Caesar's.  ``I'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout. (Looks like he'll last this one out....)  The crowd's reaction puzzled him.   They really wanted him dead. They didn't want the King of the Jews,   They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.

I can tell you that mixing them  between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless  they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one  bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that  the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent  configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit  nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte  ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent  because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM  interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry  if too techie for ya].   MG>>  Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to  gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ??  That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit  wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?   Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit  CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data  from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when  it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard  links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in  this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means  that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you  have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide  data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks  are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data  with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by  one SIMM at a time.

It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones, and (2) that DEC did.  On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in computer lifetimes) relatively old.  On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry \\\"average\\\", and that, in my opinion, SGI's history is better than DEC's.

Henceforth, if a dog decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs.   I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards.

In order to get the green card they have to return to their country and apply at the embassy there.  Of course, many somehow get around this problem.  Often it is by agreeing to practice in a town with a need and then the congressman from that district tacks a rider onto a bill saying \\\"Dr. X will be allowed to have permanent residency in the US.\\\"  A lot of bills in congress have such riders attached to them.  Marrying a US citizen is the most common, although now they are even cracking down on that and trying to tell US citizens they must follow their spouse back to the Phillipines, or whereever.    --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\"I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which is at the northern tip of the metro.

Thanks!\",\":  : Seriously, though, Griffen didn't save the lives of children, and he did : destroy the life of a man, so on the most superficial of levels, he's scum. :   I almost agree, but Griffen is not scum.  Scum has no guilt or freedom to choose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen. He made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes for Dr. Gunn.  : But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that : these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any  : assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them, : raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever : to help these children after birth? :   Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden, she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \\\"My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\\\" And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of. It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and we'll ruin it the first chance we get.  : Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real : good guess. :   And, it's probably right.  : And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either. :   It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only \\\"responsibility\\\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us \\\"feel responsible\\\" without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \\\"feel\\\" like good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say \\\"I'm good\\\", and the rest of the world can burn. Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government, because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites. But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \\\"christian\\\".  At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.  We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the biggest blessing this world can hope to see.  Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?  -- -----------------------------------------------------------------------  \\\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...

Each one is made to order, at least if you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', I believe).    See below    I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she doesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It is made of 3/4\\\" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable. It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately, professionals can open it rather easily:   1) Freeze a link.   2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).   3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are   frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.   For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is anywhere from 1/2\\\" to 7/8\\\" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type locking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8\\\" model).

If you have a driver for this card, please send it  with the OEMSETUP.INF to   bockamp@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.DE  Thanks! \",\"Hi there, I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers.  I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!\",\"(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.  [AFS]     Just a quick comment:: [AFS] [AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians. [AFS] [AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?  Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was  quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi  revisionists say!  [SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups) [SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother. [SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were  [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy  [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not  [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.  OK.  [SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my [SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these  [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe  [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people, [SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...  There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever  killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish  genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers away!  [SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people [SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women', [SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed [SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these  [SY] people not to hate all Armenians.   I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.  [SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region, [SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation. [SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some [SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts. [SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish [SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [SY] very easy to start a fire!  Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through  Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians  militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement  caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years  earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek ->  Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople ->  Massachusetts.   [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience [SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were [SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to [SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.  My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential, local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive  today.  [SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense. [SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But [SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why  [SY] should they become enemies?  \",\"I've been asked to supply more specific directions for automated fetching of the source and documentation for \\\"agrep,\\\" the powerful similarity pattern matching tool.  It is at  cs.arizona.edu 192.12.69.5  in directory  /agrep/README /agrep/agrep-2.04.tar.Z /agrep/agrep.ps.1.Z /agrep/agrep.ps.2.Z  (The .ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs;  a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is included.)  Note for Macintosh MPW users: after a few hours of drudgery, I ported the tool to MPW 3.2.3 running under System 7.1. If you would like me to e-mail a binhexed copy of the tool suitable for dropping in to your MPW/tools folder, please write...  Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool I've been having lots of fun picking up the \\\"lost\\\" references to things I'm interested in. For example, starting a search like:  agrep -1 -i 'Burning Chrome' cyberpunkspool   immediately finds references like 'burning crome' that I have always missed before.  See how many times John Gilmore's name is mentioned in the CUD archives (and how often misspelled).  How about _your_ name?  As usual, I will e-mail the uuencoded tar.Z upon request if you cannot do anonymous FTP.  \",\" From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than Smith! -)  Anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesn't care where they get basketball players from, major league baseball doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except Cuba, that is).  Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary  supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the forseeable future.  Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.   Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate, if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again, the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of  Americans, not because of Europeans.   Crawl into a hole and die...    \",\" yup.  with onions, of all things.\",\"It's like refusing 'God's kingdom come'.

With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are  'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.

Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil?  Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His   generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to   Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are   in Christ? What brings us these:     fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?         which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?     fears of being humbled?     fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the   sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us   by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's   opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,   instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can   not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these   are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:   \\\"We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that   with prayers __even wars can be prevented__.\\\" but then she continues:   \\\"You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you   have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__.\\\" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:   \\\"prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life   as what the Gospel brings.\\\"? Why not do so?  How?  To the world?   \\\"Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word.\\\" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many?   \\\"The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.\\\"  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because:   \\\"You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you.\\\" but she follows this with:   \\\"You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how   you have lived this day.\\\" Why does she constantly conveys:   \\\"Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray\\\" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns:   \\\"Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.\\\"  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman   and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:   \\\"If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.\\\"   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  \\\"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children.\\\" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.\\\"                                                                          And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from \\\"Latest News of Medjugorje\\\"        Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The \\\"Introduction\\\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \\\"OK\\\" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...  So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title (James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think I recall a (older) series under the name \\\"Harper Commentaries\\\".  Also there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD.)  My favorite one-volume commentary is the \\\"New Jerome Biblical Commentary\\\".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent.  NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the \\\"Jerome Biblical Commentary\\\", copies of which can still be found on sale.\",\"I should have guessed.

The documentary disucussed Koresh's \\\"Christ\\\" status inside the cult,  cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader  gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let  others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is  technically child abuse or not.   All true.   Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the  history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history  and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding  what happened at Jonestown.  Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may  also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses  they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in  this badly handled affair.   It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)  at this point.   Interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.

I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake of my life!)  Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit. The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger; a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.  Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.  The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.

Quite likely, actually.                                                        [...I believe \\\"Jesus    only\\\" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \\\"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\\\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like \\\"one essense and three persons\\\".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term \\\"three-fold\\\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  \\\"Jesus only\\\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase \\\"in the name of\\\".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \\\"in the name of\\\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use \\\"in the name of Jesus\\\" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.\",\" I thought I posted this last year.  The women came to court with three witnesses; the two women that were in the car and one neighbor that heard me shouting.

The net result was a $500 laywer bill for me and $35 court costs for her.  The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $35 while $500 is not quite one week's beer money for me...\",\"Greetings and Salutations!

Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces  when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate  substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.    Phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to  degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will  accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until around age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.

I am not in favor of paganism.  I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non-Christian aspects of Easter as presently celebrated.  (Incidentally, Easter eggs are not non-Christian; they are a way of ending the Lenten fast.)  My point was to distinguish between   (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and   (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but nowadays is not understood or intended as such.  Many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).  It would be illogical to claim that one is \\\"really\\\" worshipping a pagan deity without knowing it.  Worship is a matter of intention.

In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;  // in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app; // of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(\\\"blaaa\\\", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++) // real prog returns when \\\"Exit\\\" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, \\\"test\\\", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app; // use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(\\\"sleeping...\\\\n\\\");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created. (It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the \\\"sleep\\\" in the main prog, despite the XtDestroyWidget call).  Anyone see something I'm missing?  Thanks very much.

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:  1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).     The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.  Both systems have 3.5\\\" and 5.25\\\" floppies.  2.

For these  options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees  any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking  (I don't know very much about these beasts):  1.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of  the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60 thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place. This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule, is said in the document.     Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan, and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.    It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine, food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the  sick and the wounded men.--O--   60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES        BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar region, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the Armenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar. According to press -service of Azerbaijan president, no one survived the tragedy. --O--   SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR     BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000 citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar  went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters could not land near these villages because of shelling from the Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop food and medicine to the encircled people.    Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are  settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja.  Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical  aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people.

Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and medical aid.    Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life all over the world for help.    Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression  of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.    Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of  Armenia against Azerbaijan.

Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti- azerbaijani action of the \\\"Sadval\\\" society in Moscow. He also marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in the whole.

In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of  the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army retreated several kilometers.

It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .   Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.    Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of  Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked in the document.    It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.    It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia  have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.    The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor.--0--   Serdar Argic\",\" Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe to say the original poster is already familiar with such stories.

Wong     UofT:(416)978-1659 wongda@picton.eecg.toronto.edu    Electrical Engineering\",\"      There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother (Clipper) chip.      The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them.      A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \\\"There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group.\\\"      For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers.      Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved.      For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local \\\"law-enforcement\\\" people.  I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high.      The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country (even with a court order obtained by showing \\\"probable cause\\\") is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right.      I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I vote for morality.      I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression.      To most of the American public, the word \\\"hacker\\\" has rightly or wrongly come to mean \\\"high tech adolescent vandal\\\". It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act.      The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing, and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should evaluate another approach.      EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved.      Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.

I tried it without the pipe, by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and  undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.   Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service. Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred.   Can you spell \\\"loss leader?\\\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader  for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.    But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide  comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had  risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.  There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD  substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers  are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.   (RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)    The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government  intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \\\"government bureaucracy\\\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account.  jsh \",\"                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Your ignorance is obvious from your posting.   1) Cyprus was an INDEPENDENT country with Turkish/Greek inhabitants (NOT a     Greek island like your ignorant posting claims)  2) The name should be Cyprus (in English)  next time read and learn before you post. \",\"I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the \\\"vent\\\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation. That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.   Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.    Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, \\\"Cogito, ergo sum,\\\" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.   As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable. \",\" Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.

The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).   If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.

Year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio    1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04 1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12 1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20 1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14 1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19 1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24 1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98 1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14 1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97 1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17 1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17 1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96 1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12       1446/13-->1.11     1444/13-->1.11  It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect  on runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year  that it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year)  and a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as  Atlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego. Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.\",\"  I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two home runs).  Or do they?  What is \\\"equivalent average?\\\"  One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed,  hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.     Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park. I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player. Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.   I'd put him about there too.    Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so  at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't winning.  Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction; the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \\\"error.\\\"  Sometimes a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players. (It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. \\\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\\\" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's  worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are  other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not. It's got some error.  Oh well.

Your fascist government got away with  the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying  the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away  with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in  Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem  districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished.     Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included     the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,    Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,     children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians     joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan     districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of    3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished    to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to    the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and    seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell    into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims    themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels    also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the    large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from    occupying the city.     The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out    the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the    neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They    raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'    distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.     At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,    Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible    atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in    the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the    neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.     Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the    Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four    villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,    they continued to spread death and destruction among the    Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down    their arms.

While in FUSSR, one  may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans.  One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The  only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the  individual always wear business suits, etc.   The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the  claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary.

It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.\",\"Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

USA \",\"Though some may argue about the nose of the camel, it's worth noting that the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony. If it is only used for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to easy-to-break inverters.  Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap. Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files, let's focus on this.  One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.  Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal less threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no secure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \\\"goat\\\" can eavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones.  -------  Reading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.  Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of depositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week, and that system has worked pretty well.  From my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that need to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in return we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be checked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to be, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries, while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.  ------  In discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and noise of some previous threads.

ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive,  and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on  it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician  Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by  having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is  necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it,  and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard  drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad  sectors a week.           Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with  an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this  message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program  and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining  for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about  sectors for a brief period of time.           I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the  exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the  same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went  to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough  there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG,  but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors,  either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the  cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.           Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix  them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are  no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other  files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them  for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to  completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through  the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.           Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on  my hard drive?

If you read the surrounding passages you would understand what Jesus means by \\\"life in the world.\\\"  But as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk, and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly what Jesus means by eternal life.    Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding material?  Why do you such with the Bible?

For  eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship with God.    If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of hell in Luke 16:19-31.

This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the problem-- thus the French election and Italian pulizia.   Regarding the post-pulizia Italy:  Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord. The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy. Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.  (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)  Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\",\"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition. Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the \\\"Family Values\\\" positons of the '92 convention.  Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications support.  The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes. Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.  Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989 to manage Legatus, a \\\"nonpolitical\\\", Catholic businessmen's group. Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4 million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign.  The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.  The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged \\\"quotations\\\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin \\\"massacre.\\\"  You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology. At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding \\\"quotations\\\" that support your preset opinions.  If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your \\\"quotations\\\" have an axe to grind, and therefore you must be very careful about whom you \\\"quote.\\\"  For example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar, and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy \\\"quotation\\\" that you can use to attack Israel.  Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \\\"scholar\\\" when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled. It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence, you will see his \\\"indictment\\\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as \\\"scholarly,\\\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.  The Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" never took place as the propagandists tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \\\"massacres.\\\" Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for \\\"massacres,\\\" even if they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews like to do it, for reasons of their own.  Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin \\\"massacre\\\" stuff with facts or scholarship.

You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly, the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate. They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.  The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality.

I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:    Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that \\\"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\\\", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like \\\"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective...\\\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \\\"real\\\" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.    I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.    True enough.   One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction. I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

I can't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard. The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works.  I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service lines are toll calls.

Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside capital investment in the Southern states.  #  Craig A.

The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \\\"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\\\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:   Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,  but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal  of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of  all things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, \\\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\\\"  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------       NINETEENTH LETTER       MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'    In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away; then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. \",\":  :  I have an 8514/A card, and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode  :  (normal 8514/A font, not small).

I like a few of the new      Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey     unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper     than upper Aerostich.  Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other  layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out  lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows,  shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a  reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would  be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.  SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s}  One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.

Unfortunately, I was unable  to post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm  posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of  regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be  useful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an  example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters  and data related to organ transplantation and donation.

Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman  trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant  Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University  Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in  transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is  a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and  always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a  very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our  hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence  will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be  cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome  Dr. Teperman.             WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE   LAST MEETING  It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of  TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being  able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.   No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored  again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island  Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many  braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good  conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,  a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not  able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to  discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,  an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient  was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year are:           Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two year's experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.   And best wishes to all coming out of the flu.

After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias.  The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in  the ass.  Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active.  Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

A much more likely explanation is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented, but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now. -- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com) \",\"This is an all-point team for the Canadian NHLers who are not playoff bound...

Here are some observations gained from painful experience:    1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called \\\"Chig Away\\\" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money.\",\" . . .                                          ^^^ The Syrians?  Iranian agents?

What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes  certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All of which is subjective.    What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist  takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.  This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality.  But there exists no objective morality.  Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of  the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).  Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL  projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress.  It didn't work.)  The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level.  In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the  Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total  amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus  package for ALL projects.    The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities.  If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue.  A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally  supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending, arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than \\\"Washington bureaucrats.\\\"    Is it clear now?

I live in West Philadelphia, and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica, then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!   Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:   1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike    the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an    out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem     to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on    Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20    minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the    country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score    being reported on WIP.   2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss    from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have    both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.    The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely    on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.  Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\",\" I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not missing something obvious here...)  Basic Scenario:   I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of  files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users   connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public  key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the  one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The  result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it  is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the  machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed  system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal  private keys during the authentication sequence.  Questions:   Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any  information useful for a search give me any protection as far as  being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)   It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am  assisting in \\\"entrapment\\\" (the users would send thier key anyway  and are not being enticed into doing something they would not  otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?   Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?  Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...  jim\",\" I am ordering the Actix graphicsengine ultra plus. It is the same price as the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and fastest chip from s3.  Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE FOR THEIR REVIEW.   They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very good dos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local bus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers.  Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400.   AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).  If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.  P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie: games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip (ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have \\\"comparable\\\" windows performance and are cheaper to buy.\",\" Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias's \\\"proposal\\\".  I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.    Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An  instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to  Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted, and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but \\\"mongrels\\\" formed from the pure Gypsy  race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between  the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also  true that towards the end of WWII even the \\\"purist\\\" Gypsies were  hunted down as the theory was forgotten.\",\"           Nice try Deepak, but \\\"tough Whaler squad\\\" should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.  If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff \\\"take\\\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with \\\"winning spirit\\\" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \\\"hot\\\".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their \\\"sudden death\\\" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.

Verses:    1 Corinthians 6:9-10    Colossians 3:5-10  As for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is:  \\\"Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?\\\"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling question.

I'm hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various switches and jumbers are used for.  Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.        The only identification printed on the board is \\\"MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD\\\" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words \\\"SERIAL NO\\\", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers \\\"1990 2 8\\\".  Anyone have any clues?

While  most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who  are in \\\"private practice\\\" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their  patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get  your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for  the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.

RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.  Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.  If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to implement it, we might avoid government control.  Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through the Clipper Chip.  Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one, would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.

It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.   What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you, at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses.  Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to. Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.

Best offer above $4500 takes it. \",\"  The company was probably \\\"Public Missiles, Inc\\\" of Michigan.   Yup.   Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get  hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. \",\" From _Cycle_World_ magazine (5/93) (who usually never says _anything_ bad about any motorcycle):  \\\"The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of.

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., \\\"kill\\\").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

The most efficient system is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such as England's or even Canada's.  I'm afraid we are on the wrong track.

That was my point all along, Fred.      I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \\\"he started it.\\\"  \\\"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\\\"  \\\"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\\\"  Besides that, I think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \\\"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\\\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!      First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win, can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.   *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \\\"people aren't required in all parts of all space processes\\\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \\\"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\\\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.   No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though it's no worse than your own.

If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  \\\"Net.ghod wannabe\\\"?

However, if scumbag's insurance is Scum insurance, then you may have to pay the deductible to get your insurance co.'s pack of rabid, large- fanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurance's lawyers.   Sad, but true.  Call it job security for lawyers.  Later,\",\"  Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall. Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.   If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah, I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing \\\"technically\\\" smart  hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made  a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.   Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to  each his own...   I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at  all.   Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go  around.  Who would you rather have as your \\\"checking\\\" centre?  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky or Mario as my \\\"checking\\\" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey?    You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If  Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he  should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen- sively.  Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel prize then I suggest that you had best \\\"settle down\\\".  And if you are going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you \\\"settle  down\\\" before you bother following up on my postings.    You might consider developing your own style.

If they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone     to come up with an implementation which was identical, but     lacking an escrowed key.      Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was     being kept secret for security of the key escrow system.  In this     case security means \\\"an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip\\\".

If the system is really secure, then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure, so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but I certainly can't think of any honest ones.  Next, you assume we can \\\"trust\\\" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked, EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is saying \\\"Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.\\\"  Bullcrypt.   And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score.  Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand. Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra cash...  The following is more true than ever:    \\\"When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong] encryption.\\\" \",\" ...and then his \\\"fantasy\\\" begins...

There was nothing \\\"off the wall\\\" about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.  I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates? Combs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs and owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily obtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even.  Even better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings, but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.   \",\" It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by Freeman Dyson et al many years ago.

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.

In virtually all major revolutions including England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the  revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term  growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible.  If \\\"poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,\\\" this typical historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.  [Much deleted...]   Sorry, buddy, but some other \\\"blowhards\\\" managed to include the \\\"general welfare\\\" in another portion of the constitution.  Article I Section 8: \\\"The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL WELFARE of the United States...\\\"  I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they said in the preamble.   But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?   But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional functions.  Right?  jsh\",\"In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and forth.    Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  That's not very good odds.    Somebody once said something like: \\\"Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\\\"  Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.  I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.

To suggest that AIDS is \\\"deserved\\\" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from  sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail. I surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided  the Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation. If AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do we all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.  To willingly judge \\\"others\\\" as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.      So what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in \\\"deviant\\\" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS of deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be infected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors, many of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors carry the risk of transmission.      The end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so I could get AIDS.

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because of the suspension.   Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.  I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.     True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the '30's.   Yes.   \\\"Autobahn\\\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.   Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.   You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal  autobahn car.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their plan !  (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith)  What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.  However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.  As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion. \",\"First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding:     Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.     Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.    This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.      (deletions)    No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: \\\"Why nothing exists?\\\" This is equivalent to my counter-question, \\\"why nothing exists in nothingness\\\".   Now, \\\"why anything exists\\\" is equivalent to \\\"why something exists in somethingness\\\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.   I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question \\\"why this, and not that\\\", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.   This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?   Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better. My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have to admit, but I am patient.    No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.   It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  \\\"why do I exist, in particular\\\" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.    I think \\\"pre-existence\\\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.    No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?   This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.   I think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \\\"why do I believe\\\" or \\\"why I don't believe\\\".

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D (predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi.  With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.  But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13\\\" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local distributor of NEC. With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then. But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some \\\"spiky\\\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc. With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu... With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.  I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?

It does not go into great detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM. It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.  CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS ---------------------  - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,   in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign   messages with your private key.    RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard   cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with   RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a   huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.  - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,   since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow   an attacker to claim to be you.    DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be   compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies   have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each   message has a different DES key, the work for each message would   remain high.  KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS ----------------------  - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking   RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived   from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy   of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network   packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.    The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the   private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run    RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of   you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)   which nobody else has physical access to.  - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could    allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him   rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your   intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with   the other bogus public key and pass them along.    It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.   The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent   has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be    given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key   authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is   not always practical.  Having other people \\\"vouch for you\\\" by   signing a statement containing your key is possible, although    RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as   PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys   in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for   authentication.  PLAYBACK ATTACKS ----------------  - Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could   still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message   with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)   to Alice which says \\\"OK, let's do that.\\\" Your opponent intercepts   it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is   authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may   interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent   could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,   figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the   opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register    your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient   will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the   unknown message.    To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should    include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique   identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM   should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be   sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within   the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that   the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be   automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at   automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated   headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in   the utils directory.  LOCAL ATTACKS -------------  - Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of   the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under   UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,   although it would take some planning and effort to do something like   replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of   the plaintext, depending how it's stored.    In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is   an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine   which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an   eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your   passphrase.)    RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In   the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,   which you have total control over and which nobody else has access   to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of   viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between   convenience and security here.    A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation   where other people have access (even root access), but increase   security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of   course) executable on a floppy disk.    Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing   in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their   own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the   security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since   you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just   given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and   install traps in your account to steal your private key next time   you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the   situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of   cleartext password authentication.    I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my   security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that   potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are   in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not   carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated   with greater care for critical correspondence.  UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -------------------------  - RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key   corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the   traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she   may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There    exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an   ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by   you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this   functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically   states that such transformations should be possible to allow   forwarding functions to work.\"]],[\"SUBSET\",[\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\",\"train\"]],[\"label\",[\"soc.religion.christian\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"rec.autos\",\"sci.med\",\"sci.space\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"sci.crypt\",\"comp.sys.mac.hardware\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.autos\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"misc.forsale\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"comp.sys.mac.hardware\",\"rec.motorcycles\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"misc.forsale\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"comp.graphics\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"alt.atheism\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"sci.electronics\",\"comp.windows.x\",\"rec.autos\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"talk.politics.misc\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"rec.autos\",\"alt.atheism\",\"alt.atheism\",\"sci.electronics\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"comp.graphics\",\"talk.politics.misc\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"comp.sys.mac.hardware\",\"talk.religion.mi
