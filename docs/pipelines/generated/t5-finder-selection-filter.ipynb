Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is drawing near. Look up!\",\" Wasn't there an 85,000 New York at Cleveland game in the late 40's?\",\"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.     Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter?  One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of  his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric.   This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \\\"race\\\" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be  emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to  govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a \\\"strong\\\" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness.  It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide.   The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.  No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon  election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A  rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.  It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a  task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security.  Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to  control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot  affect the system. \",\"   Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- ***** \",\"Folks,  I am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   \\\"program\\\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.    Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL  61820 (217) 355-6000   fax: 217 355 8925  NIH IMAGE ---------   Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)   zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.   It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting   things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of   images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined   convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw   data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also   does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac   that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)  PhotoMac --------   Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700  PhotoPress ----------   Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973  PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------   \\\"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

It is easily   extensible through \\\"script\\\" (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.\\\"    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   \\\"An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.\\\"    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the \\\"auto selection tool\\\"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.

Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by \\\"painting\\\" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator \\\"paint\\\" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII.

Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: \\\"Laplacian, medium noise filter\\\", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

SOFTWARE TOOLS --------------   It's a set of software \\\"tools\\\" put out by Canyon State   Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I   heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).   JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------   Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.    Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,   (800) 874-1888.  Microbrian ----------   Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card   (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of   super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing   system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use   a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.   Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by   CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is   marketed/ supported by:    MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria   tel + 61 3 724 4488     fax  +61 3 724 4455)    There are educational and commercial prices, but be prepared to set   aside $A10k for the first educational licence.  Subsequent ones come   cheaper (they need to!) It has installed sites worldwide.  It is widely   used at ANU.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.   Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical   image community. They issue a newsletter also.   They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last   I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.    It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.   Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of   documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.  ALV ---   A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to   comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to   alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.  AIPS ----   Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - \\\"AIPS++\\\" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.   LABOimage ---------   (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently   runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.   The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.   It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis),    medicine, biology, physics. It is distributed free of charge (source code).

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Supports 24-bit display\\\"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

Thanks for any help.  --\",\"April 16, 1993  INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL  The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.  However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency.  The so-called \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into its communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .  First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.  Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.    Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to answer.  In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.  Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen, but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.  The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source, secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?  COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY  The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption, and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.  FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org) Daniel J.

I really would like some advice on what would be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR 600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a fast learner, and in love.  Please give me any advice that you think would help me in my search, including places to look or even specific bikes that you want to sell me.      Thanks  :-)\",\" You're right.  Thanks for enlightening me.\",\"        There are a couple of ways to look at them.  One is, \\\"We want you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think will appeal to you,\\\" or the more straightforward, \\\"This is why we think what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea.\\\"         You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.          Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and  probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules. But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the government?         And is writing in support of something automatically \\\"propoganda\\\" to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what they don't believe?          If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also. (In fact, they both were, because the British government had much greater power than did the American system).                 I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington put it (whose name I forget), \\\"Congress has become everybody's city council.\\\"         Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.         It is not a case of the system of government they created failing, but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level.          Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an \\\"extraordinary\\\" manner.          I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's opinion) policies.           There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos.          Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and  fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?         Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required?         Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not see this as a positive thing.  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans are looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question. \",\" I have a simple test. I take several people who can speak only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english). Then I let the \\\"gifted one\\\" start \\\"speaking in toungues\\\". The audience should understand the \\\"gifted one\\\" clearly in their native language. However, the \\\"gifted one\\\" can only hear himself speaking in his own language.  Works everytime. 8-) Perhaps I would believe the \\\"gifted ones\\\" more if they were glorifying God rather than themselves.

Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.

Jim -- jmd@handheld.com\",\"   The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)  The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately, System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.   Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1, but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable. Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it.  Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get rid of the bugs.  Any better suggestions?

It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government, you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with no restraints. Yes? No?  Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a kibbutz?

I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking. Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to \\\"go ballistic\\\", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | \\\"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.\\\" \",\" Since everybody wants to see Pittsburgh players not playing, the Stanley cup would be devaluated.  --  _____________________________________________________    Iskander AYARI\",\" Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not _The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola, travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when one of them drops a fob watch.

The proposal clearly states:  => The initiative will involve the creation of new products to => accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure => telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David. Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.   That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean secure) encryption is used. What will happen when (\\\"if\\\"? Ha! optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of these \\\"some\\\" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes on the former (\\\"almost nobody\\\") - which is clearly an improvement - and \\\"forgets\\\" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (\\\"guaranteed\\\"). Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.   It's not just \\\"continued ability\\\". It's -guaranteed- ability.   Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't think about the future. Trust us.   It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.   Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure, of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell, that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that mentally pervert...   Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm) has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any details whatsoever and has concluded that it is \\\"highly secure\\\". I guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David Sternlight has already done all the job for them...   \\\"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.\\\"   \\\"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of future safety, do not deserve either.\\\" This (or something like that; I don't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said by one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more carefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.   The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying \\\"we guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as just a default, voluntary implementation\\\", there would have been much less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?   No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.   While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't you simply trust them, huh?   It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It might be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a wild speculation.   The trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.   Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I guess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys?

Regards, Vesselin\",\"  For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.   I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively. Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred  to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group  can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might  support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.  Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.     Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might  convince your local police departments to switch.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.\",\"    There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players. The \\\"whole Russian strategy\\\" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.\",\"All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident, get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they would in an accident they caused.

I respond.       The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise      before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against       that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox      belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),       the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).       The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent      on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was      contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the       cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of       the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

My head (helmeted) hit the pavement with a \\\"clunk\\\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack. This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force. They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection. (I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)  The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected.

It should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders, i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders (under the control of other ones among its orders) is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if part of the memory is used as a \\\"function table\\\", then \\\"looking up\\\" a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify, or rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which controls this \\\"looking up\\\", and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question.  On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.\\\"  david cary, tenor, e- and comp. engineering (finger caryd@a.cs.okstate.edu). 227 S. 163 E.

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.

I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email, followup to t.p.g.  1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get    a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I    was told by a police officer. 2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however. 3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will    be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.    The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.      Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess    them, but will not be allowed to stock them. 4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will    not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some     manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.    (God knows how much they'll charge for these)  This covers most of what we discussed.

Further, the early church bears testimony to the impact.   Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus?

I've  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  \\\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\\\" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                   ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |    good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than     all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can't tell us.  \\\"Read Aviation Leak.\\\"  He also apparently had a good      propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile. \",\" Ergo, if your life is sufficiently boring, you have no need for privacy?

I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani  neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \\\"Khalida, what's going on, what  happened?\\\" She says, \\\"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what  happened.\\\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,  each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their  heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I  don't know.  My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \\\"Oh  dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\\\" And he says, \\\"What are  you afraid of, they're just children.\\\" I say, \\\"Everything that happens comes  from children.\\\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and  Vocational School. \\\"Don't fear,\\\" he said, \\\"it's nothing, nothing all that  bad.\\\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.  When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and  there and I said, \\\"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to  kill us.\\\" And he says, \\\"Don't be afraid.\\\" Then we heard--from the central  square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \\\"You speak Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\\\" He says \\\"Close the window and go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\\\" He listened a bit and then  closed the window and went to bed, and told us, \\\"Come on, go to sleep, it's nothing.\\\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was affecting him. I say, \\\"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute too.\\\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.  Things had calmed down slightly.  The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \\\"Come on, Emma,  get up.\\\" I say, \\\"Today's my day off, let me rest.\\\" He says, \\\"Aren't you going  to make me some tea?\\\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \\\"Where are  you going?\\\" He says, \\\"I'm going out, I have to.\\\" I say, \\\"Can you really go  outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take  the car out of the garage, go without the car.\\\" And he says, \\\"Come on, close  the door!\\\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it out, he probably said \\\"coward\\\" or something.  I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said, \\\"Khalida, was it our car?\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited, it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I said, \\\"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\\\"  Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm  standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,  they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten  o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore, and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.  I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I  don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see  it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \\\"Mamma,\\\" he says, \\\"look what they're doing over there!\\\" They were burning everything, and there  were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing  on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are  throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony  is shouting, \\\"What are you standing there for, burn it!\\\" When they threw the  television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out  on her balcony and shouted, \\\"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their  home. Why are you burning them?\\\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \\\"Go  inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in  your building or not?\\\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,  they said, \\\"of them.\\\" She says, \\\"No, no, no, none!\\\" Then she ran downstairs to our place, and says, \\\"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\\\" I say, \\\"They've killed Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without  Shagen. Let them kill us, too!\\\" She insists, saying, \\\"Emma, get out of here,  go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my  daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\\\" I gave her the key  and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \\\"Igor, you stay  here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\\\"  Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and  Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in  the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,  and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \\\"Madar,  Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the  garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \\\"He shouts, \\\"Aunt  Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for  him.\\\" I say, \\\"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,  I'm coming too.\\\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \\\"You stay  here with us, I'm go look.\\\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \\\"Aunt  Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \\\"Madar went off again and  then returned and said, \\\"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's  there . . . wheezing.\\\"  Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \\\"Don't go near him,  or we'll put you next to him.\\\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and  said, \\\"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take  Alik, maybe he'll live . . . \\\" They grew up together in our courtyard, they  knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and  called, and called, and called--nothing.  I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \\\"Two police cars drove up over  there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still  lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \\\"We watched out the window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said, \\\"Igor, you stay here at home, don't go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\\\"  At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another  doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \\\"Doctor, is  Shagen there?\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\\\" I  wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there, they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They said, \\\"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\\\"  It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with them. I say, \\\"Sara Baji [\\\"Sister\\\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've probably brought Shagen.\\\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back and says, \\\"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\\\" Now Shagen  just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they  said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \\\"Doctor, they've  brought Shagen in dead.\\\" He says, \\\"Why are you carrying on like that, dead,  dead . . . he's alive.\\\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back  the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \\\"Doctor,  is it Shagen?\\\" He says, \\\"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\\\"  I say, \\\"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,  if not today, then tomorrow.\\\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the office. He says, \\\"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\\\" Another one of our  colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous  condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes  later another colleague comes in and says, \\\"Oh, poor Emma!\\\" When she said it  like that there was no hope left.     That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured  people.  At night someone took me home. I said, \\\"Igor, Papa's been killed.\\\"  On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:  I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is  surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \\\"Hey, citizen, where  are you going?\\\" I say, \\\"I work here,\\\" and from inside someone shouts, \\\"Yes,  yes, that's our cook, let her in.\\\" I went right to the head doctor's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to work with us at the hospital. He says, \\\"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku. In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\\\" I say, \\\"Doctor, how will I bury him?\\\" He says, \\\"We're taking care of all that, don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you spend the night?\\\" I say, \\\"I was at home.\\\" He says, \\\"What do you mean you were at home?! You were at home alone?\\\" I say, \\\"No, Igor was there too.\\\" He says, \\\"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\\\" His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov.  The \\\"ambulance\\\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a  patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the  hospital until the 4th.  Some police car came and they said, \\\"Emma, let's go.\\\" And the women, our  colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \\\"Where are  you taking her?\\\" I say, \\\"They're going to kill me, too . . . \\\" And the investigator says, \\\"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive identification.\\\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \\\"Let's  go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\\\" And when I saw the caskets, lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \\\"I can't look, no.\\\" The investigator says, \\\"Are there any identifying marks?\\\" I say, \\\"Let me see the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\\\" He says,  \\\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\\\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his  finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had been injured at work . . .  They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they  brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \\\"Oh,  they burned him!\\\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat  down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \\\"Well fine, fine, since  we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . \\\"  On the 4th they told me: \\\"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\\\" I cried, \\\"How,  how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform  his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\\\" They say, \\\"OK,  you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they  get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\\\"  He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in  Sumgait. They asked me, \\\"Where do you want to bury him?\\\" I said, \\\"I want to  bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\\\" I'm  shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \\\"Do you know what  it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean,  arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone  anymore.\\\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He says, \\\"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,  if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \\\"  Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.  Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,  \\\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\\\" He says, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Well look, here you're  describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\\\" He says,  \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"And now you're telling it differently?\\\" He says, \\\"Well maybe I  forgot!\\\" Like that.  The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a  Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were  involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports  jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \\\"What's your nationality?\\\" He  says, \\\"Armenian.\\\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \\\"If he's an Armenian, kill him, kill him!\\\" They started beating him, they broke seven of his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too  . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he  had an armature shaft. He says, \\\"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,  that's where I got it.\\\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he had already had it. He said, \\\"I hit him twice,\\\" he said, \\\" . . . once or twice on the head with that rod.\\\" And he said that when he started to beat him  Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,  \\\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment, killing someone,\\\" he says, \\\"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or not?\\\" I said, \\\"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you came back to hit him again?\\\" He went back and looked and he was already dead. \\\"After that,\\\" that bastard Tale said, \\\"after that I went home.\\\"  I said, \\\"You . . . you . . . little snake,\\\" I said, \\\"Are you a thief and a  murderer?\\\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They were taken. He says he didn't take them  When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \\\"How can you  have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\\\" He said something, but I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \\\"You still haven't straightened  everything out, I think that's unjust.\\\"  When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.  In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . .  And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good  craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his  own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the  time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the  Army. And now they're fatherless...  I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15 years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't know what to do with myself, I said, \\\"How can that be? You,\\\" I said, \\\"you are  saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'  deprivation of freedom?\\\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \\\"Let me at that creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \\\" A relative restrained me, and there were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\\\" This isn't a  Soviet trial, this is unjust!\\\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .  I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,  they were shouting, \\\"Long live Turkey!\\\" and \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" And during the  trial I said to that Ismailov, \\\"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\\\" I  still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet  Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still don't understand why \\\"Glory to Turkey!\\\" I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\"Hi.

If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No other demand is necessary.   You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight.

The people of  Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never  abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally  hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole  perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July  15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop  Makarios.  Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with  the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right  given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently  and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For  those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island  since 1571.   The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the 'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences  for this irresponsible conduct.               THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM  2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus  It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the 24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum.  AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS  The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed...  The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent, are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.  Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded during the same terrible event.  \\\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan. Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs. Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain. Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open. Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard voices saying, in  Greek, \\\"You want Taksim eh!\\\"  and then bullets started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks, who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.  When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was brutally murdered.  In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying \\\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\\\"  I became terrified. I thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed.  An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who were all wounded.  We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.  There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter.  After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus, Greeks arrested me at the Airport.  All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my detention. They then released me.\\\"  ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER  We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five days.  We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some terrible sights.  In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A child's bicycle lay in a corner.  In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three children piled on top of their murdered mother.  In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the head.  This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.  Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

Date : 1 January, 1964.    IL GIARNO (Italy)    THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.   Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we  are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people  abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This   time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to   cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.   Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno  Date: 14 January 1964   DAILY HERALD (London)   AN APPALLING SIGHT  And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.  In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16  wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.    DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)    GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE   Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the  Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found  crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were  brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three   more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could  not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to   locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

I have a Quadra 950.  I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"I am posting this for a friend without internet access.

Thanks, Pat \",\"Hello src readers,  Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox Churches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion about it a while ago.    Then OFM comments :   With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference was clear: \\\"You have nothing to do with the Church.\\\"  These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called \\\"the nature of the incarnate word\\\", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures \\\"human\\\" and   \\\"divine\\\"  that are   united in   one \\\"without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration\\\" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \\\"did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye\\\" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \\\"semantic\\\" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \\\"To the  Coptic Church, faith is more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us.\\\"  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren't.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.\",\"  hmmmm.. not sure, since no such beast exists.. i can tell you another though..  you won't catch me dead in a GMC Syclone or Typhoon either, 1000 bhp or not.. not even the fact that Clint Eastwood has one.  just my taste,  no rational reasons for it.

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its \\\"quality\\\" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games). \",\"Mr. Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so.

In the German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg 49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%. So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of German voters.  Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties. Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed Chancellor.  What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.  Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis. If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had begun to decline.  Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher, who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others, knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together.  Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:     The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their    failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,    in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of    the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their    opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine    against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm    them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.  True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him *before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties (Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis. Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over. \",\"In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and forth.    Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.  The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot?  In a new Civil War?   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens and paper.    Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic (or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over five thousand years of written history.  That's not very good odds.    Somebody once said something like: \\\"Armed Violence is meant only to be used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.\\\"  Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.  I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't want my children growing up in a War Zone.  \",\"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls \\\"Geode\\\" (\\\"rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside\\\") or the \\\"ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.\\\"  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. \",\" It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)  For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get both feet on the ground when you stop.   The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.  Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.\",\"  ...

Why no +10? Because they do not want to overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since  they are doing nothing.     the average bias of what you read would be probably around -9, while that of the average American would be the same if they do not read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and -8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.\",\"SIGKIDS CALL FOR PARTICIPATION SIGKids Research Showcase is where learning is hip.

That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.

I find the weight shift can be very sudden and  unnerving. It's one thing if they're just getting comfortable or  decide to look over your other shoulder, but I don't recommend having  him/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent.    Also (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger  wears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or  lacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I  won't let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle, but  I wouldn't want to hurt anyone else, so I don't let them on without  gloves, jacket, (at least) jeans, heavy boots, and a helmet that *fits*    Go *real* easy. It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the  handle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel like  she's going to slide off the back, and \\\"snappy\\\" turns for you are  sickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlled  and smooth as a passenger. I can't stand being on the back of my  brother's bike, and I ride aggressively when i ride and I know he's  a good pilot... still, everything feels very unsteady when you're  a passenger.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.   I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW, Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad, and excruciatingly prolonged.)   I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting so gloomy?   No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.   Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors. Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a six-year free agent before the 1992 season.   Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.   But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.   But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign him.   He certainly wasn't last year.   Hey, that's the \\\"Skates Smith\\\" package deal.  Anybody who acquires Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is a real weirdo.   If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.   It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to the Bucs' future.   Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on this?   I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I *seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is pointed at his feet.

After all, when you grab under his chin and are careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is he going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed his upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other.

By all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention, STOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a victory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not even a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP, and sit there, 99% of dogs will say, \\\"Oh, shit! This guy's serious!\\\" and back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog, and it probably will not bother you again.  Llamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama, it will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're lucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and steal it!\",\"ac = In <9304202017@zuma.UUCP> sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) pl = linden@positive.Eng.Sun.COM (Peter van der Linden)  pl: 1.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly     included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or     the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The \\\"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\\\" ASC G&C 2102,   \\\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  in second stage.\\\"      This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try     to interpret.      1) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2) Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  \\\"relative wind\\\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  negative angle (\\\"a negative q-alpha\\\"). This causes a little bit of  \\\"downward\\\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  direction) and this force \\\"alleviates structural loading.\\\"  We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  most \\\"delicate\\\" part of the vehicle.      3) The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  the case if we didn't roll (\\\"performance gain\\\").      4) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\\\"decreased abort maneuver  complexity\\\").      5) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  antennae on the Orbiter (\\\"improved S-band look angles\\\").      6) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, \\\"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?\\\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \\\"top\\\"     [Orbiter side] and the \\\"bottom\\\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the     Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics. He added that the \\\"roll     maneuver\\\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a \\\"quaternion,\\\" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It's worth asking if yours doesn't.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

What's the deal on them?  1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?  2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?  3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem? How much slower is it?  4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT, or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non- Microsloth) apps, for example)?  5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position, let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

They obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists. BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled) Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture, along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.  The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking it back.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"  And not only that, made a second clone from the same tissue sample after that of said domineering wife, to run at the helm of the more-pro-business party under guise of more free trade ... and she did inhale, many times, to boot ...

The sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  A \\\"reasonable person\\\" would arguably have driven the car.  Had an accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.  As a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.  As a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (BTW, it wasn't \\\"somebody's\\\" spot, it was resident-only, but unassigned, parking). \",\"After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens (Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also very good.  How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty?

Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.   (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:    Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God   imputeth righteousness without works,   Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins   are covered.   Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational distinction is unwarranted.   I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver was considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting speculation, though.  I'll leave comments on the so-called \\\"bema seat\\\" vs. \\\"throne\\\" judgments to someone else.

Anyway, it's written in about ten places that the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the  highway as for bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the  two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see  bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or  open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of  bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound  sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.   Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that  splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it? Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?\",\"To: milsh@nmr-z.mgh.harvard.edu (Alex Milshteyn)   AM> Having said that, i might add, that in MHO, MSG does not enhance  AM> flavor enoughf for me to miss it.

The Russians usually treated the people   well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these  places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.  They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the  Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality  problem.

The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are  organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is  the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.   Two.   Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does  nothing for you.   80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.   There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible  with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you  get them from guarantees compatiblity.

The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\" Last I checked I was one person, I haven't even been elected as a representative for \\\"gaydom\\\".

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st period:  1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert. Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2nd period:  The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rd period: The Kings used the phrase \\\"Initiate, not retaliate\\\" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.  5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at  8:19) took penalties.    5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.  Notes: ------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.  The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a \\\"use deduction\\\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\",\"I would like more info on this if anybody has it.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan Klesko's MLEs.   He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best hitter in the majors.\",\"   They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are incorrect (see below).   No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX) should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.   There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses. Your file should look like this:  137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver> 137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>   Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.   Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also, but  apparently they don't.   Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address.  It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.

A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, \\\"Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!\\\" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has come.

Anyway...)   The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\",\"==============================                               GASPRA ANIMATION                                 March 12, 1993                        ==============================       The Gaspra animation is now available at the Ames Space Archives in  QuickTime format.

The processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed to increase speed among other things.   I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without  giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when  you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions. Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to  its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?   Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a processor to speed it up.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"I need to know the Pins to connect to make a loopback connector for a serial port so I can build one.

I am not         convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_  information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's        likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly   *wrongful* disclosure.   - GAO: perhaps.

Blackman, Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89. -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear sir:  By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of  momentus \\\"scientific\\\" findings. These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings. Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists.  The latest effort -- \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities,\\\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying  editorial, \\\"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\\\" by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular order.   1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   support the statement that \\\"some have argued that restricting  access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  of homicide.\\\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  contention.    2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  are very different with very different demographic characteristics  which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.    3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?    4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \\\"control\\\"?  Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  \\\"scientific\\\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  rate *exceeds* that of such \\\"wild west\\\" cities in Texas as  El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  Springs. (Ref. 3)    5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  handguns \\\"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  Vancouver.\\\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  legally for protection, registration figures are  meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  has a greater \\\"prevalence of weapons\\\" than New York City.    The second method of measuring gun density is \\\"Cook's gun  prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  differences.\\\" But the validation was by Cook of his own  theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  (42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  Vancouver.    6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  the case.    7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  the authors of the NEJM \\\"tale of two cities\\\" fail even to mention  most factors related to crime control.    8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  involving firearms.    9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \\\"study,\\\"  editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \\\"applied  scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  handguns.\\\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  be mistaken for \\\"scientific methods\\\" by a sociologists or  criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \\\"study\\\" is the equivolent  of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   announcing in a \\\"special article\\\" a new medical breakthrough.  It would be nice to think that such a \\\"study\\\" would neither be  funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.    Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  make them willing to present shoddy research as \\\"scientific  breakthroughs\\\" in \\\"special articles\\\" and editorials relating  to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  the distortions contained in \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\\\" and \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call  for Science.\\\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

Wright           (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\\\"  The problem is demonstrated    by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting    to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by    the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal    of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and    suggested that a handgun ban \\\"may reduce the rate of homicide in a     community.\\\"       The nine medical doctors who published \\\"Handgun Regulations, Crime,    Assaults, and Homicide\\\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite    many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver    has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations    make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems    indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period    1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.    Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,    Why?       The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case    to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,    that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their    evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and     unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point    does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support    of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody    knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We    are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that    a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates    when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.       Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two    indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-    weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons    permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable. *     The second bit of evidence is \\\"Cook's gun prevalence index,\\\" which stands *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in  *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms. *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides, *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general  *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \\\"prove\\\" it on the basis of *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.       Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that    guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.    The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun    ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates    reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,    that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.       In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of    violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the     consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin     Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime    for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke    an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.       Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data    on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \\\"similar in    many ways,\\\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law    stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish    the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \\\"all    else is equal\\\" among things being compared. *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look  *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent. *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out. *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver. *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks, *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain *  in either city.       Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the    cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority     groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \\\"gun availability\\\"    (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not    matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why    blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed    in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,    do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)       Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between    Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have     anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol     abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city    of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the     Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the    United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian    percentage?       The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many    ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent    more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \\\"many ways\\\" might explain part    or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such    as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal. *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide *  result in a \\\"complex picture.\\\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They *  also acknowledge that \\\"socio-economic status is probably an important *  confounding factor in our comparison,\\\" remarking further that \\\"blacks    *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of *  Vancouver's population.\\\"  Given the evidence presented in the article, *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility, *  since \\\"detailed information about household incomes according to race *  is not available for Vancouver.\\\"       The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in     gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple    example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms    of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one     would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.    Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce     crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into    account?  In this example, the \\\"hidden variable\\\" is city size: Guns are    more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city    problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the    appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very    seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities    for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,    and their results are impossible to interpret.       In the editorial \\\"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\\\" accompanying    the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the    authors for applying \\\"scientific methods\\\" to a problem of grave public    heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from    nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate    plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them    out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are    little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this    study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical    identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--    is cause for further concern.

We'll probably end up giving them weapons.   During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia.  I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in the outcome of the war.   Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's about all we have to go on, isn't it?    And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.

Finally, the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.  Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like a big moto party.  After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.  Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  think was \\\"big\\\".  Then I put one foot up.  \\\"Heavy\\\" came to mind very quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.  By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.  Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz.  The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack oft featured in \\\"Spencer for Hire\\\" -- a place where you could really  find \\\"Spencer\\\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.  About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal for \\\"hold on tight\\\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.  Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \\\"get off in a mile\\\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.   My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\",\"...  I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, \\\"Windows will only use ...,\\\" is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:   PageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:   This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of  linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is  computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to  the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value  specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the  amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data  structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity  proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a  value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,  you must edit SYSTEM.INI. \",\" A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the propeller.

Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.  I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption front end on it.  There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.  The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones. (Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )\",\" Why?

Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for  what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of   ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of  civilians.   ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact  that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones  and we ought to pick a couple.''   Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the  former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have  a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.   Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to                      ****************************************************  the radical Islamic government of Iran. *************************************** O, I C!

It's the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also occur.

Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA) I found that there were few states in the provences that stood out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to  name the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have  always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states. And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the same.

Contact your sysadmin for more info).  These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in many places (see below)  --  Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article. This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]  There's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field  --  The inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the Subject 4: Mail servers )  --  The Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list. It's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of indexing.  --  Another place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files. For more info contact Robert E. Maas <rem@btr.com>  --  Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH (Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:  interactive:   telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as \\\"info\\\". Move to the   info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the   00index file by typing \\\"/\\\" and the word to look for.   You may then just read the FAQ in the \\\"faqs\\\" directory, or decide   to fetch it by one of the following methods.  ftp:   login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and   enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a   password.   cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings  mail:   send e-mail to  RFC-822:    archive-server@nic.switch.ch X.400:   /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/  Enter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information is required in the subject header line.   1. ARCHIE =========  The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups.  Archie servers:   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)  Connect to Archie server with telnet and type \\\"archie\\\" as username. To get help type 'help'. You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session. 'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc, vol. 27.  To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with subject \\\"help\\\" to \\\"archie\\\" account at any of above sites.  (Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000]. Connect to it and specify \\\"archie\\\" as the host name and \\\"archie\\\" as the username.)  ==========================================================================  2. Notes ======== (Excerpted from the FAQ article)  Please do *not* post or mail messages saying \\\"I can't FTP, could someone mail this to me?\\\"  There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like \\\"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\\\", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  ==========================================================================  3.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the \\\"reply\\\" or \\\"answer\\\" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.  Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called \\\"The Graphics BBS\\\".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144   V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.    If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:   server@bobsbox.rent.com.    For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in   the body of the message:     HELP     /DIR   And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.  [ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it  out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]  INRIA-GRAPHLIB --------------   Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail   server a few months ago.      echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and    how to browse among its files.      echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the extended summary.    As an other example :      echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr    will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from   comp.graphics.

As published in \\\"US Industrial Outlook 1993\\\"  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be \\\"adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.\\\"                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  \\\"Space Business Indicators\\\" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request \\\"launch on demand\\\"  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should  provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/\\\"Spacelifter\\\" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all \\\"ELV upgrade\\\" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \\\"Spacelifter\\\"  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \\\"GO-AHEAD\\\"    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture  by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a \\\"Star Wars\\\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \\\"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\\\"     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analyst's report Morgan Stanley said \\\"We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.\\\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has  hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and  I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an  investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \\\"Aerokosmos\\\"  winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \\\"Severkosmos\\\",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new  venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This one's a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the  Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:   - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity  in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \\\"the main  alternative rocket supplier\\\" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and  funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of \\\"off the shelf\\\" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellite's communications channels.      [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the  release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \\\"Asiasat- 2\\\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based \\\"Asiasat\\\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's  aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its  national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \\\"made in Korea.\\\"   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set  120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!        !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!                            ! 120rtn_____________________!  modified set for 2 level brightness:                  string 1 120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!   \\\\_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!     5w    !      string 2     !           b   ________________! 120v rtn__!___!               ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.  Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness. \",\"    Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)       Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say, but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are claiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve those for c.s.m.a :-) )     I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one (1.5).     They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by 3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.      Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.     Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was from memory!     Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the  animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?     Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.     But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in  my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.     But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it,  no longer CD-I. \",\"   As usual, when Salah is not totally racist, she manages to get virtually all the facts wrong.  Assad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria, but not to go to Israel.  Unfortunately, not all of them have escaped yet, but not because they don't want to leave;  rather, Assad went back on his word and stopped issuing travel permits.  He claimed bureaucratic snags, but everyone knows it was a tactic to pressure Israel.\",\"A quick query for Powerbook gurus: Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180 batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one, (M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my battery and there is no obvious exterior indication.

There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        \\\"People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,\\\" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  \\\"When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.\\\"       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Association's medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        \\\"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\\\"  says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.\\\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        \\\"Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,\\\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \\\"We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \\\" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      \\\"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's  rarely particulate matter,\\\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \\\"However, PM10 doesn't have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\\\"                                HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993                 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma  The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on  Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in  dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance  techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care  professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological  characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management,  and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi  and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in  preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily  in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; \\\"comprehensive\\\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for \\\"comprehensiveness\\\" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.   These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse  for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical  education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with  other users.    To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                        FTP.UCI.EDU  The Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope  to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).    Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you  have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education  efforts, either as an instructor or student.    Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either  the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the  mode to binary and \\\"send\\\" or \\\"put\\\" your files.  Note that you won't be able to  see the files with the \\\"ls\\\" or \\\"dir\\\" commands.  Please compress your files as  appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something  similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.    After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for  MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you  have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.  Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated  as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.   Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the  existence of this FTP site.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   \\\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\\\" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  \\\"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV\\\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.  In addition, researchers have long been familiar  with the  --------- end of part 3 ------------ \",\"  No, VGALIB?  Amazing..  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :-) Thanks for correcting me.

I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.           As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd say certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who they gave money orders out to.          There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebody  brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of \\\"buy back\\\" programs.          \",\"  I have (had) several problems with the card. - Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing   the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256   does just fine. - Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a   256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning   off the hardware scroll (\\\"24xmode scrolloff\\\") before entering the graphics   mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.   With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the   window. - The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware   cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.   Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-   for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-   unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal   VESA drivers do not run at all). \",\" Actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed *said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they  considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

WABC did the same thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30, because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of  the reasons for this is left to the reader ...  It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair, SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.  From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this.

But there are some very important related facts that            Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of            most other world religions.                             First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-           STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master            (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,            a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and            after the life of Jesus.                      The followers of some of these Masters founded the            world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of            their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added            THREATS of \\\"ETERNAL DAMNATION\\\" in Hell, and DELETED the            teaching of REincarnation.                         Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular            Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is            NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively            few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY            alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE            UNIVERSES.)                                              Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and            pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from            their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed            themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly            MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                        And emotional \\\"feelings\\\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING            indicator for religious validity.                      These things are similarly true for followers of most            other major world religions, including Islam.                       Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune            His Initiates into the \\\"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\" or \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\", (referred to as \\\"THE WORD\\\" in John 1:1-5, and as            \\\"The River of Life\\\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally            guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they            are still connected to their living physical bodies by a            \\\"silver cord\\\".                      True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of            REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved            only by reaching at least the \\\"SOUL PLANE\\\", which is five            levels or universes above the physical universe, and this            canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine            Master.                      One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri            Harold Klemp, the Living \\\"Eck\\\" Master or \\\"Mahanta\\\" for the            \\\"Eckankar\\\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,            (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                      Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now            living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \\\"Sant            Mat\\\" organization.                        One of the classic books on this subject is \\\"THE PATH OF            THE MASTERS\\\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA             90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian            and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India            studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of            that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                      Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored            by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in            most public and university libraries and some book stores, or            obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \\\"ECKANKAR--THE            KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\\\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER            classic.                      Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with            the \\\"Anti-Christ\\\", which is or was to be a temporary world            dictator during the so-called \\\"last days\\\".  But the Masters            don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as            Jesus was.                      People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or            other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will            CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the            Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they            finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine            Master.                                 RE-INCARNATION                           The book \\\"HERE AND HEREAFTER\\\", by Ruth Montgomery,            describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation            as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past            lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes            makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],            SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of            whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,            homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-           ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-           ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-           ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS            FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the            Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How            can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED            BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \\\"KING JAMES VERSION\\\".  Later            versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                            Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,            typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,            a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually            results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.             And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to            another person being met for the first time in THIS life,            because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS            INCARNATION.                  The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF            KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would            behave much better toward each other if they knew that their            actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the            future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!               \\\"2nd COMINGS\\\"                 If a Divine Master physically dies (\\\"translates\\\")            before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that            Initiate physically dies (\\\"translates\\\"), the Master will meet            him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul            Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd            Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that            happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still            waiting for Jesus' \\\"2nd Coming\\\" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                       PLANES OF EXISTENCE                 The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN            major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the            Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric            Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),            the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The            Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from            the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the            Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                      It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological            influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See            the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without            an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between            the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                      The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a            sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \\\"Hades\\\", and the            Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there            LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some            kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a            THREATENING manner.  The Christian \\\"Heaven\\\" is located            elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there            for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                             SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH                 The Christian religion demands of its followers an            extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more            than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                         If a person is not HEARING some form of the \\\"SOUND            CURRENT\\\" (\\\"THE WORD\\\", \\\"THE BANI\\\", \\\"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\\\"),            then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL            CONTINUE.                      The \\\"SOUND CURRENT\\\" manifests differently for different            Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on            the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a            flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,            Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as            a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \\\"SOUL TRAVEL\\\")            REPLACE blind faith.

It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of the intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their demonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danish reporter who covered the initfada, I know of at least one case where he found out that a \\\"mass demonstration\\\" on the outskirts of Gaza was setup for himself and his colleagues.  When I asked whether the footage shot was sent he replied affirmatively, \\\"after all, it did happen.\\\" When this became the case, the IDF began closing sensitive trouble spots to reporters.  \",\"  Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to (usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use \\\"slower\\\" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

He said, \\\"This soul, this thing of clay and sod, Has sinned. 'Tis true that he has named Thy name; But I demand his death, for Thou hast said, 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.' Shall not Thy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead? Send now this wretched sinner to his doom!

Then quickly One rose up from God's right hand, Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes; He spoke, \\\"Each jot and tittle of the law Must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies!

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, \\\"getting away from it all\\\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. \",\" [...Dr. England's story deleted, it was a nice read the first time  through...]]    It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts  that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of  *fabrication*.   About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called \\\"Son o' God\\\" comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said  the magic word, he turned into \\\"Son o' God.\\\" He went from a myopic,  curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.    Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus,  and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.   This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was. \",\" Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the chip?  (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet)  Skipjack sounds like a normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be  voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt  Compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless they want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...).

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\"There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost, unless you're a franchise player. \",\" Actually, info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. If you have technical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.   I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...)\",\"Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size of Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.  Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?  I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port. (other than Appletalk).  BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo, and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond 3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.\",\" Good!  Not very.

The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X, what does the manual claim that this jumper does?  To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the BALE line?  On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,     music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing     complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well     defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far     exceed their technical skills.      The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression     tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and     virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the     observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of     simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar     representions, a confounded user asks: \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"      Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and     ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by     physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media     radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic     communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for     composing imagery for understanding.      Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a     breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the     physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,     psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and     discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the     computer graphics context.

(audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there was a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible \\\"thunk\\\".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage.  My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \\\"bank-follower\\\", or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the mystery.  The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm fairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.    Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without damaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid ?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life goes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.\",\" That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other. \",\"I write:     and a (You've hardware The the set same programs programs forget having   After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I came up with: ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.

That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?

Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat By:  This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.   2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter  of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your  are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.   In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are  an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time  and energy on it.\",\"Hello,  Can anyone give me their opinion on which system has got the best overall system performance;  486/66DX2 with ISA-BUS or 486/50DX2 with EISA-BUS  The systems are equal in all other areas.

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list:  1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them   concurrently.  2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac  and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice  with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)  3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For  instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor  212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will  work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the  termination, plug it in, and away it goes.  4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that  the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is  quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:  to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very  noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

However, who is at blame is another question. It seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions-- realizing the risks--is to blame.   Yes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this.   And I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact, many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents.   But, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals on the road.  Again, the blame is on society.   Yes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses.   Okay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not all such \\\"murders\\\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong, no matter what the circumstances?   But, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?   Murder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing it at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is.   Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth matters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That is, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.   But then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the conviction was unfair.   Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.   But what we know has no effect on an objective system.   Why are you so sure?   Why is *your* reality important?   But, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely. And, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system.   Well, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal. We can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible.   Yes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.   We must realize the consequences of all our actions.  Why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack?   I don't think our country has an objective system, but I think such an objective system can exist, in theory.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  \\\"What is atheism?\\\"  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong atheism\\\".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \\\"strong atheists\\\".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  \\\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\\\"  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  \\\"What is agnosticism then?\\\"  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (\\\"strong\\\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean \\\"weak atheism\\\", and use the word \\\"atheism\\\" only when referring to \\\"strong atheism\\\".  Beware also that because the word \\\"atheist\\\" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  \\\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\\\"  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  \\\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\\\"  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  \\\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\\\"  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  \\\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn't it still a religious belief?\\\"  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \\\"the redefinition game\\\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \\\"agreed fact\\\", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question \\\"Isn't atheism a religious belief?\\\" depends crucially upon what is meant by \\\"religious\\\".  \\\"Religion\\\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   \\\"religion\\\" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of \\\"religious\\\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \\\"religious\\\" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  \\\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?\\\"  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called \\\"acts of faith\\\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is \\\"certain\\\".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  \\\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\\\"  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \\\"for\\\" or \\\"against\\\", \\\"friend\\\" or \\\"enemy\\\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be \\\"anti-religion\\\".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being \\\"anti-religious\\\" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a \\\"live and let live\\\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not \\\"socially acceptable\\\" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \\\"convert\\\" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of \\\"state atheism\\\" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  \\\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that's the same as state atheism?\\\"  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  \\\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people  pray?\\\"  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  \\\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't  atheists object to the religious charities?\\\"  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To \\\"weak\\\" atheists, building a hospital to say \\\"I do not believe in God\\\" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \\\"Today is not my birthday\\\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  \\\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\\\"  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  \\\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\\\"  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  \\\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\\\"  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\\\"right\\\") and unacceptable (\\\"wrong\\\") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from \\\"anti-social\\\" or \\\"immoral\\\" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a \\\"moral\\\" or \\\"compassionate\\\" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave \\\"immorally\\\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    \\\"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.\\\"  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after \\\"born again\\\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being \\\"born again,\\\" 12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation; 5% after.                                 [\\\"Freethought Today\\\", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  \\\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\\\"  If you mean \\\"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\\\", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean \\\"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\\\", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \\\"moral rules\\\" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  \\\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\\\"  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  \\\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\\\"  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the \\\"Big Brother\\\" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  \\\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!\\\"  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as \\\"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\\\" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  \\\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\\\"  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for \\\"meaning\\\" or \\\"purpose\\\" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that \\\"life\\\" is the sort of thing that has a \\\"meaning\\\".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \\\"What is the meaning of life?\\\" is as silly as asking \\\"What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?\\\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  \\\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\\\"  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  \\\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\\\"  The short answer is \\\"No, do you?\\\"  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  \\\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments  apply?\\\"  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical \\\"default position\\\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  \\\"What sort of harm?\\\"  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being \\\"healed\\\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  \\\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.\\\"  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  \\\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\\\"  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \\\"weak\\\" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  \\\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\\\"  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \\\"correct\\\" it is, or whether it \\\"works\\\"; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  \\\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?\\\"  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  \\\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?\\\"  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  \\\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?\\\"  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of \\\"memes\\\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  \\\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\\\"  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.     It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change    yourself.     Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.     If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.     Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

EDT              Q   Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's  protest today?              THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.   I think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago,  which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase  minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we  should.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.   And I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's  a legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an  informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to  the game.  So, I think it's good.              Q   Do you think they're moving fast enough?              THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first  step.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an  issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to  give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will  highlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.              Q   Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate  on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break  that and get cloture?              THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I  mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one  of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you  know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate  the majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not  like the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they  can stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a  lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote  for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political  pressure not to do it.                And, of course, what it means is that in this time when  no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an  economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're  willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston  and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very  sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in  a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans  had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the  program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots  level, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they  have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep  Americans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.

We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as \\\"justifiable wars\\\". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith \\\"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\\\"   (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \\\"God rules in the kingdoms of   men\\\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be \\\"strangers and pilgrims\\\" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We   are not supposed to \\\"strive\\\" or \\\"resist evil\\\" (even \\\"suffer yourselves to   be defrauded\\\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  \\\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God   the things which be God's\\\" (Luke 20:25). \\\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God\\\" (Rom 13:1-2). \\\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\\\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any   ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are God's \\\"bond servants\\\" and His   service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col   3:22-23 where bondservants were to \\\"work heartily as unto the Lord\\\" - so   also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \\\"Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over\\\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is \\\"testifying\\\" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \\\"fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\\\", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to \\\"lay aside every weight\\\" that we may   run \\\"the race that is set before us\\\", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - \\\"Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier\\\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is \\\"be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers\\\". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as   them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18   - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says \\\"take my yoke upon you\\\", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \\\"become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2   \\\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\\\". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \\\"sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord\\\" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   \\\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\\\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal   yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us \\\"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters\\\" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into   it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant   relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in   nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -   this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor   10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit   further. \",\" DA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.

Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier  times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off  the map.  .......  As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of  Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt  that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been  the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke  apart.  .......  I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and  people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,  a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the  town, called her community \\\"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\\\". She and  her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.  .......  \\\"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and  the government does nothing.\\\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,  said. \\\"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\\\" said Dilbar, his  wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in  the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.  ......  \\\"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.  There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then  all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had  just entered their trap.\\\"  The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian  forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in  the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying  as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading  towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge  from the Armenians.  \\\"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\\\" said Omar Veyselov, lying  in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \\\"I saw my wife and  daughter fall right by me.\\\"  People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the  loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \\\" Where is my  daughter, where is my son ?\\\" wailed a mother. \\\"Raped. Butchered.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH  ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO  INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...  As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw  the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as  they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to  journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts  of the hills.  The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING  of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians  last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death  or missing...   Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter  as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there  was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer  ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We  swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon  under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.  We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round  again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a  valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung  round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired  repeated blasts.  Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting  had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed  enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in  fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.  I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,  its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on  \\\"our side\\\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a  search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.  Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two  M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed  flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second  crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains  and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters  were there to give covering fire if necessary.  The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet  armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani  official told us that there were now five former Soviet military  helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \\\"They have  signed contracts to fly for us,\\\" he said. The helicopter we engaged  in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian  pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.  We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an  heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer  white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four  corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an  Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies  on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back  towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before  the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.  Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the  civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were  covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor  mortis. They had been shot.  What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,  and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY  DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME window without a title bar; ie   (WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION    I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.  I have another question:  I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc) The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another  child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings. I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes behild it's siblings.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves \\\"Defensive Catcher\\\" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves \\\"Offensive Catcher\\\" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and don't walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's) (the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)  Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.  Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.  Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign. OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?  Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!  Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees could be \\\"persuaded\\\" to act up.  There's always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?  Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.  Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.  Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?  Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get $3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?  Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common, if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!  Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez into the lineup.  Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?  Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May.  Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!  Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those \\\"happy pills\\\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you ever hire that guy anyhow?  Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.  ------------------------------------------------------- Eric Roush  fierkelab@ bchm.biochem.duke.edu \\\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\\\" Grafitti, Paris, 1968  TANSTAAFL! (although the Internet comes close.)\",\" Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)\",\"I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts algorithm.

Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression \\\"R-dot-bar sub n\\\" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a \\\"dead\\\" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a \\\"dead\\\" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:       SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first       craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was       also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images       from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8       accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were       unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil        to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in        1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's        surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished        with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in        1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions         lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with         VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in         February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.         Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe         became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending         through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before         reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles         similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet         in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in         1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the         first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar         mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.   VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of   planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian       atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on       to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in       March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased       enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian       surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian       surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red       Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander       signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to       fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in       1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.       probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit       with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest         moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to         human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did         enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week         before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:   Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  Inclination : 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  Period  : 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name?  Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians,  drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well, anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the  Nazis.   \\\"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously   pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,   as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and    anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\\\"[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'      Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.    As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots)  was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but  had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II. In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the  American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization. Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:   \\\"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.   Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\\\"[1]  [1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\\"The     Armenian Displaced Persons,\\\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,     1949-50, p. 19, footnote.   Now wait, there is more.  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \\\"Hojali Disaster\\\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \\\"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\\\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \\\"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\\\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \\\"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\\\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \\\"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\\\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \\\"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\\\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \\\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\\\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \\\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\\\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.

This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the \\\"super-apostles\\\" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  \\\"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\\\"  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the \\\"praying of Jesus into your life for salvation\\\".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.

Can someone help me ?\",\"  The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case: \\\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\\\".   This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.   If you mean \\\"menu accelerator\\\", no it's not possible.  That's according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.   I can't think of a reason why not.   There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade        -- filePulldown - openPushbutton          - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\     Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)  You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.\",\"I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card.

America!   Here! Here! \",\"        Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \\\"thermal  pollution\\\" de-icing a river, said, \\\"Up here, we view heat as a resource\\\".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\",\"I've a curiousity --    Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day,   the person is on the list longer than the specificed time    I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't  remember what...

Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule', after him, and at the same time as him. The current models do not resemble Kekule's.  Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.  I don't think \\\"extra-scientific\\\" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.  Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the \\\"Newton of mirror-image life,\\\" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\",\"On March 21, 1993 Roger Maynard wrote (in reply to an article by Graham Hudson):    This was <1993Mar21.223936.6192@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca>, for anybody who would like to check.

In Congressional hearings later, the newspaper folk admitted that their reports were completely wrong.  (Some of their excuses are understandable, while others amount to gross negligence.  Then there's their \\\"we lied\\\".)  As far as I know, they never did the followup.   I don't have any relevant knowledge about the counter-sniper tactics or what the govt did with the big war toys.  That's why I've only commented on what they couldn't have accomplished, no matter what they did.   Not in Detroit, not during the 60s.  That's newspaper copy and they admitted later that they were wrong.  -andy\",\"  At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists \\\"believe\\\" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.  I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome (but perhaps we should change the thread subject).\",\"  ------------ Part 10 of 14 ------------ M:J\\\"U$$,^UM[>WE/M[>V+BXN+BXN+BXN+BXOM[>U34U-34[\\\"PL!D9<7'2TM+2 M/3T]/3T]F9F9`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`$!`0&$`0%XGG5UP,#`P%M;%*JJJFMK\\\"0G/S\\\\_/SPD)-C9N MV=E&!UDS4G9V4I5960<'$=G9V=G9V=EN;FYN;FYN;F[9V=EA86%A!05L;&QL M!04%>7F3DV-CDY.3DY-C555555555555555L;&QL$A(2$A(2;&QL556TM!$1 M[NXV-C8)J@F`\\\"6L\\\";MD1$3,S4G83$W924I4S,S,S$1$163,SE5)V=G9V4@$!

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander         of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,         Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)  \\\"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the  liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the  allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of  the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian  was permitted to approach the city and its environs.   While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained  in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the  area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to   attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the  plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder  of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by  the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers  who had remained in the rear during the war.   One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of  soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of  seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,  and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud  and dirt...   It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and  traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds  and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night  patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The   Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear  also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the  trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for  fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder  and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.   Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir  Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander  in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.  The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals  that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its  highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half  of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.   ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,  Odishelidge. They were as follows:   The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the  act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...  More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been  killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless   Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the  murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood   near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:  'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten  more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when  the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.   The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently  fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.  Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw  towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew  to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and  destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.   During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages  that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the   Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers  were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time  when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill  the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries  of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the   Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would  have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from  acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with  hatred and loathing.   Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that  he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The  Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the  stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since  the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed  in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen  of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping  him with the iron heel of his boot.   Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape  from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off  by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered  children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village  of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:   There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.  Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and  spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about  25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140   centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,  children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of  rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.   A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators  for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov  to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be   proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's  disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,  instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely  reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told  the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more  licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent  and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity  and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,  the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and  claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.   An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command  narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:   The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut  out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.  The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men   of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they  took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people  among this group were able to save their lives as the result of  my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were   released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.   Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the  Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered  on the streets.   On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent  Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were  threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for  murdering an innocent Turk.    When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would   be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare  you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the   Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard  that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within  the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same   day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to  him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible  act. However no result was achieved.   In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a  natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived  the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the   Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had  been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.   The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed  one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached  three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details  of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers  were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even  withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred  people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading  Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.  However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with  the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower  classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders  of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.    I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals  were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who  opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that  it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.  Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian  cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have  supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred  to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by  the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.  You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a  conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear  of the Turkish soldiers.\\\"   Serdar Argic\",\"If \\\"I forgot\\\" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider this alternative.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is  still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the  load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground  return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load  on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high  frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff  capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.  What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,  but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent  diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly  lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably  omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,  using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high  resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with  slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for  output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.  I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for  a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I  needed.

Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion where they were both part of the same \\\"mandate territory\\\" - read colony.  Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started.    Again territorial expansion by force.    The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).    So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and  a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.    They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population.  The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the  redefinition of much land used in common as \\\"public land\\\". The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed.   No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.    Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks,   Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.  If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply.   Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.   The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.   Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace. Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.   The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state.   The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land.   \",\"Tektronix 453 scope for sale:    - 50MHz bandwidth   - portable (NOT one of the 5xx series boatanchors! :^)   - delayed sweep   - works fine   - I don't have the manual (they are available from various places)   - no probes    - $275 + shipping  Email me for more info...

A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\"Where can you get info (brochures...) on Differential GPS Systems and where to  buy them?\",\"     >This is turning into 'what's a moonbase good for', and I ought not    >to post when I've a hundred some odd posts to go, but I would    >think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic.    >    >Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much    >larger GNP than they would _without_ space industry, eventually,    >they will simply be able to afford more stuff.     If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a    lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,    but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than    just a \\\"we have the money, why not?\\\" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).\",\"Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of the AC cycle?

The word harass means to  irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.  I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.  The number of people who participate in \\\"victimless\\\" crimes notwithstanding, the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ...Dale Cook    \\\"Any town having more churches than bars has a serious                    social problem.\\\" ---Edward Abbey The opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)\",\"  Perhaps so.

There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.   If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that its soldiers die rather than its children.     Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.     Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

That was the bronze medal game in the  SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:) lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach), said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after three? seasons). I don't know why.  Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many players to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but they had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the SM-liiga.  I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants to be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe they'll do some compromise.\",\"[stuff about Dodge Shadow deleted]   What do you mean by \\\"all models\\\", all models of cars, all Chrysler models, all models that the fleet manager had bought?

Bikers wave to bikers the world over.  Whether or not Harley riders wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars... \",\"It's only test message.  \",\"  At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame war, I must disagree.    There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less training time required.    Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various  gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.   You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..   Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that 'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.   Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact, it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.

To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.)

(Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and            dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from            two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th day: Same as 5th day.                 7th day: Same as 6th day.                 All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider \\\"flavored\\\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book \\\"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\\\", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                 PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should            prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria \\\"Acidophilus\\\" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\"            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \\\"Lyme disease\\\".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \\\"Major\\\" or            \\\"Minor Periods\\\" as listed in the \\\"Solunar Tables\\\" published            bimonthly in \\\"Field & Stream\\\" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                         For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 \\\"A.I.D.S.\\\", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book \\\"Life Extension\\\", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value.  The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any \\\"absolute\\\" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no \\\"truth\\\" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.\",\"We have a minivas-2 and we want to record to an Abekas A66.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with icons which your application doesn't specifically own.  In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in  my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.

Even if we assume that these \\\"trusted agents\\\" are really entering  a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the  time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not  doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry  at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be  punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program  the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they  are feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access - the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours.\",\"I would like to modulate a 40KHz squarewave over rf.

Nazi Armenians were of service  to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known  case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian  agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission  of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and  to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied  forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda  efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among  the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism.   In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret  Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable  source for the Germans.[2]  [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150.

One thing I can't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at the moment.)  I don't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced.

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen  gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4\\\" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't  been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.

RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.      You   Uh, so?  You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players. Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game. Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.

How is this done?  I would like to emulate this behavior in my application.

The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.  Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.   In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria, the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the USA would reject them as would any other country.    The word is \\\"terrorism\\\".   The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a fitting combination of the words \\\"freedom\\\" \\\"dignity\\\" \\\"democaracy\\\" or of \\\"terrorism\\\" \\\"dictatorship\\\" etc as appropriate.  The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack.  Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move.  First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment  Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.  The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment  simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need western technology.  \",\"Posted to the Internet by wmiler@nyx.cs.du.edu   000062David42      041493003715                The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)              =========================================                         By David H. Mitchell                           March 23, 1993   INTRODUCTION:   In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:  - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:   A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \\\"floor\\\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:  1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF ACTION:   The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \\\"rail stock\\\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \\\"ground breaking\\\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \\\"action\\\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \\\"challenges\\\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!   CONCLUSION:   EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.  But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation? The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well documented, but what about anything else?  The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and  *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.  So how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits mapped?  Or is this still sci-fi?  Mail replies would be great.

Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is, through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology. Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human endeavor).   Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction?  Braking?  It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.   I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the course.   Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous. \",\"Deuteronmy 20:13 And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword  Joshua 6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, bith man and women, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.\",\"I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next.

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.  Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.  The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game. The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.   The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

Cheers, Kent \",\"I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \\\"Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\\\"  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.

It's flatly not available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.

I don't know the logisitics of the situation, but if you could just place a reciever in snow and place the oscillator in a nice lab somewhere else, your problems should be solved. Just a suggestion.\",\"  I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.  Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography. Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something like DES) for the encryption.  How could the \\\"back door\\\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.  Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most straightforward to me.)  Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a \\\"dual key\\\" property, that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.  It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\",\"Hi there,  I am looking for a wide band analog time delay (not phase delay) variable from 200 microseconds to 2 milliseconds.\",\"  I recommend the book \\\"Adams _v_ Texas\\\", the story of a man (Adams) who was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.

Everybody's got an opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any advice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.  If you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code, study it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really happens.

One might find oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.  2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to \\\"sell now and save on taxes.\\\"  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986), but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).

This is a second RFD, replacing the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The proposed groups are described below:  NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about   system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,   including issues such as security, networking features, console   mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE:  Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family  of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish  to argue about the meaning of an \\\"OS\\\").  The family ranges from  Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to  Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over  50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the  actual release is slated for May/June '93.   While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares  an application programming interface with the other members of the  Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-  dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking  and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for  Windows 3.1.   The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows  3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses  Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-  sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced  Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and  NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.   Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following  groups with the other members of the Windows family:   comp.os.ms-windows.apps   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc   comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32    The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as  well as Windows 3.1:   comp.os.ms-windows.announce   comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy    In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the  Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal  structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating  systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have  undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate  newsgroup hierarchies.   Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --  when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-  generation Windows, \\\"Chicago\\\", debuts next year, surely it should  remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-  tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD:  The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING:  The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on  the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will  be accepted prior to the CFV.\",\": The driver had looked over at me casually a couple of times; I : know he knew I was there.  oh, okay.  then in that case it was attemped vehicular manslaughter. he definitely wanted to kill you. all cagers want to kill bikers. that's the only explanation that i can think of.\",\"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]  Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30. It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began, whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.  Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of \\\"election fraud\\\" to hold their jobs.  Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too many cases, who they were).  Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.  The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room.  One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy. He said, \\\"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is always so organized every year.\\\"  I got a little pissed, and replied, \\\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\\\"  At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and several Simon's Rock anti-gun \\\"close-the-loophole\\\" protestors. (Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)  The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.  Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up to \\\"support GOAL's position\\\" on \\\"all bills.\\\"  First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students had some curfew, I guess).    Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock folks called the current law a \\\"loophole\\\" and wanted it closed.  Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \\\"SKS assault rifle.\\\" The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri, and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \\\"as strong as\\\" that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.  Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  \\\"In some of these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\\\" (Oooooo!)  \\\"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't be having this situation -- but they won't.\\\"  (Naughty, naughty!)  Next up was Boston city councilman Albert \\\"Dapper\\\" O'Neill.  He was there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were judge, he'd give arrestees their \\\"last rights\\\" (pun intended) on the spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.) He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(  Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction -- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying, \\\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted.\\\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.  Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible. \\\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\\\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the law-abiding instead of the crook.  The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga. Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \\\"restraining order\\\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He  was a co-sponsor of one of the \\\"restraining order\\\" bills as well.)  One of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \\\"every year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\\\" It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been more effective.  At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue. Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \\\"public\\\" testimony; the other got a seat this time.  Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change. He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great quote: \\\"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state computer system until 1999.\\\"  (This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card.)  Testimony was heard from several \\\"battered women,\\\" one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how 50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response.  Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts. Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.  Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law. One of the junior reps noted that \\\"this is America\\\" and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga reiterated this, saying that \\\"people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order.\\\"  (Point and match, Senator.)  Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his citizenship \\\"expired every 5 years,\\\" and that a driver's license was a privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.  A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public hangings.  The speaker then responded, \\\"I'll make you a deal.  You get me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\\\"  Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \\\"he wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside\\\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \\\"loophole\\\" should be closed to prevent something like this from \\\"ever happening again\\\".  Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on, saying, \\\"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are safe -- support gun control.\\\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \\\"Only residents can get FID's,\\\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out-of-staters completely off?)  Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental record.  One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \\\"elitist\\\".  Another (Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had \\\"FID-type\\\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home state was \\\"not enough.\\\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming, \\\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\\\"  All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and GOAL's position) were:  o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)  o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)  o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly    opposed)  o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws     (opposed)  o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)  o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)  o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)  o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)  o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)  Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.  Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.  Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it. Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said, \\\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\\\"  The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It ended at about 6:30. -- \",\"  Why don't you consider PHIGS in X or PEX lib?\",\"      Your bad English?  (See quote above.)    You'd lose that wager, if the supporting argument were part of it.   Did you know that Hitler himself was a devout Christian?  And heterosexual?  --Drywid\",\"  Would the sub-orbital version be suitable as-is (or \\\"as-will-be\\\") for use as a reuseable sounding rocket?    Thank Ghod! I had thought that Spacelifter would definitely be the bastard Son of NLS.   (And just as a reminder:)\",\"I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring from the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these chemicals than other people.  I don't remember any connection being made with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet. \",\" For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?\",\"   Possibly because gay/bi men are less likely to get married?  What was the purpose of this post?  If it was to show a mindless obsession with statistics, an incredibly flawed system of reasoning, and a repellent hatemonger agenda, then the purpose was accomplished with panache.  (a) Get a clue.  (b) Get a life.  (c) Get out of my face.  I'm not in yours.  Drewcifer\",\"  Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound  like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are  common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s) which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the local oscillator). \",\"  Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't  know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.    Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.    Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.    You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.  Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.    Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?    Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.  Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.    Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \\\"mediot\\\"  candidate, pushed because of his \\\"winning attitude\\\" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his \\\"great defense\\\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.  SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris' \\\"ability to win\\\" which is nothing more than Morris' \\\"ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\\\".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF \\\"consideration\\\".    Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about \\\"Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time\\\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)  Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.   This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]  Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands) Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?) Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities) Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier) New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot) Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)  Kansas City: George Brett (lock) Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock) Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot) Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]  Cubs: Sandberg (lock) St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably) New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain              past form) [And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]  Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots. San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot) Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)   [Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's probably

When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4 wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.  Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts.   Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.  Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read open.  I'll appreciate any help on this.

My SI subscription expired this past February, the second of  two years that I received same. Therefore my guess is that the  article appeared sometime in 1991-92.    Can anyone else be more definitive as to a date of the SI article ? \",\"* Attention voters: * * I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting. * Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV. * If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again. * (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)   Introduction:   This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation  of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:  (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)  (b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to       comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)  (c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)  (d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)  (e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)   This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer  of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules  state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started  after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).  This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and  comp.os.os2.bugs.   This document contains:  *  the background showing the need for these proposals  *  the proposed charters for these proposals  *  voting instructions  *  a voting ballot  *  some example ballots  *  the voting rules  *  the voting schedule  *  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:   The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2  and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred  a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such  as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and  much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,  allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.   Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and  later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the  number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility  with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the  availability of drivers for their hardware, installation  procedures, etc.   Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows  Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is  including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version  2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).   Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,  especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.  So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks  (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or  for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read  comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:   (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so   as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and   spur additional development.  The group will also cover   topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,   Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program   portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and   so forth.   (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)    To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy   orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to   comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup   for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and   technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.   (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)    It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the   availability of device drivers, compatibility information,   installation procedures, system requirements, and overall   performance optimization.   (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.   (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)    It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug   diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system   patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.    [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other   newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in   comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:   To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.  Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this  post.  Be sure to send only the ballot, and edit out the rest of  this post.   1)  Type in your vote for each proposal:       If you favor the charter as proposed, put a \\\"yes\\\" after its name.      If you oppose the charter as proposed, put a \\\"no\\\" after its name.      To abstain, leave a blank after its name.   2)  Type in your last name (i.e. your family name), a comma, and      your first name (i.e. your personal name).   3)  Cut out the ballot,  Please do not delete any lines of the      ballot.   4)  E-mail your ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu before 11:59:59 pm      (Central Time), April 24, 1993.   Ballot:  ----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----          (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting:         (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc:         (c)              comp.os.os2.setup:         (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:         (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs:          (f)       voter's last, first name:          e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24  ----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------   Example Ballot #1:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia:  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: no   (f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John   In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting  to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of  comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view  on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia.    Example Ballot #2:   (a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes  (b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes  (c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes  (d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes  (e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes   (f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane   In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all  the proposals.   Voting Rules:   * One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most    recent vote will be counted.   * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,    forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.   * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings    will be revealed only after the poll closes.   * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will    post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).   * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how    voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.    Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is    posted to news.answers on a regular basis.   * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this    CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.   * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal    passes if both of the following formulas are true:    1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes        by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).    2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the        number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).    In other words, a proposal passes if:        YES - NO >= max (100, NO)    where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:   The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted  by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).   This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the  Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who  have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you  have not voted yet, vote now!   The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on  April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.  The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that  date.   Mass Acknowledgement:   Here is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots  as of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:                            bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu Aiyagari,

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace  development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of  Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.  If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally  reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as  Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh  ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.  But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to  realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese', each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $  #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str, /* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buflen,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset); /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */  #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include \\\"I18N.h\\\"  extern \\\"C\\\" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,       char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */      int wc_len,  /* IN */      char *buf,  /* OUT */      int *buf_len,  /* IN/OUT */      int *scanned_len, /* OUT */      char **charset) /* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,            buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) {  xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));  *charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else  *charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, \\\"Xlocaleint.h\\\", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:     _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.  In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP's implementation.  Thank you. \",\" Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and found what I was looking for.  ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one for CapsLock).

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. \\\"You say that we teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ?\\\" And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home. The term 'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings.  Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday, some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes, one after the other.

However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?  Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays) Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs. Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.  Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays). Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs. Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.  Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a  different SS.  Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall. --  Dale J.

Making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not mentioning peace or agreement). I also know several tens of jokes about arabs (palestinians) but I DO NOT post them to Usenet (Anyway,not to THIS newsgroup), since I don't think I will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and this is NOT my target. If this is your target...well...that tells a lot about you.    Did you really think he is talking about something realistic?   Yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line, so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. And if parents want their children alive,I think it would be better that before they get out to throw stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children in the houses.                ^^^^^^^^^^^^----\\\\/                          Look in the dictionary at the word \\\"terrorism\\\"!

Yeah,sure.The truck driver looked in the car with his Zionist Equipment of Detecting Palestinian Children,and then he thought to himself:Hey there is a 5 year  and 2 weeks girls in the car.Why won't I make an accident and kill the \\\"enemy\\\"? Maximum I will die too in the crash...But what do I care?...   Well,It was about 3 years ago ,in the Intifada (The fact that  you can't remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). I DO NOT think that what the soliders did was correct. But I will not agree that they \\\"were breaking their arms\\\".I saw that film,and,unlike in the USA,it was broadcasted entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the \\\"arm-broken\\\" guys got up and walked and used their arms very good. They guy who did it was interviewed and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take his orders,and spitted in his face. What ammount of truth exist in this statement I cannot tell you,because I wasn't there. But the guy who did it was in prison,if it makes you any good.   No,it didn't.

It only states that it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before.

Clearly, occupation is an    undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate.   Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the  Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.

Re: your statement of  occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.     Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to    protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing    Palestinean human rights.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.   I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in regardless.   Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.

What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?  The second section shows the sequence of events. The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are talking analogue telephony here). What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use? Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained? I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.  How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.   This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group, that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case. Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get to fish in the escrowed key pool as well. \",\"Hi,   the subject says it all. Is there a PD viewer for gl files (for X)?

Phil    ------- Forwarded Message  Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?\",\" Well, the first 2 are easy.  You need the math library.  Try adding -lm after -lX11.  Don't know if that's the whole problem but it's a start. \",\" As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.    This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?       First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"I'm looking for a font that looks like pixels off of a monitor (not the lcd kind of font though) does anyone know where I can get one? \",\" It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.

May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \\\"God Loves You.\\\"  Isn't    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:         For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John 3:16           The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he       loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9         For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of       the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6     Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There       is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans 3:10-11         The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately       wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9     Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of       beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy 32:22-24     Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15         So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come       forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and       gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50         ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting       destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9     Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23         For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:10         But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew 12:36     Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6         But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;       and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5         For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4         For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians 5:21     Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he       that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36     Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,       and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew 6:24         Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19     Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none       other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts 4:12           I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the       Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6         If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John 1:9     Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13         ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts 16:30-31     Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of       yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8      God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans 10:17     Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a       contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17      Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26     Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9     Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:       and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are       alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be       with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17     Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter 3:10,13     Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew 24:14     Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3         Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7     Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4     Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil       way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9     Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3         In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,       and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for       us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8                     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?       A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:         title:       1994?       author:      Harold Camping       publisher:   Vantage Press       distributor: Baker and Taylor       ISBN:        0-533-10368-1     I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

I read a good book while I was away, THE ANTIBIOTIC PARADOX: HOW MIRACLE DRUGS ARE DESTROYING THE MIRACLE, Stuart B. Levy, M.D., 1992, Plenum Press, ISBN:0-306-44331-7.  It is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  It is interesting & written at a level which I think many sci.med readers would appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to this particular information. I.e., it assumes you are smart enough to understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in microbiology or medicine.

But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are  camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad,  civilians die, right ? I am not so sure.   As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there  at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general,  no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ?  Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea. How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly  recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.   I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was  to kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were  killed, i do not condone it.       Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3  israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.  If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a  question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?   Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ?

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  I'm happy.

State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   \\\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   \\\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.\\\"   \\\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\\\"    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.\\\"   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).  Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area. Plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast corridor(PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland). Whereas,in the Adams you have only 3-American based teams, out of which 2(Buffalo and Hartford) are not in Top-20  US TV-markets.\",\"    I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the 14th or due process or whatever.   Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge. However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating Mr. King's civil rights.   AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once,  it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states, it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also, I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws. \",\"  A \\\"fuel injector cleaning\\\" at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner, and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the cleaner yourself for $1.29.   Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.

suspicious.\"]],[\"SUBSET\",[\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\",\"test\"]],[\"label\",[\"comp.graphics\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"sci.space\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"sci.electronics\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"alt.atheism\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"comp.graphics\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.autos\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"sci.space\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"sci.med\",\"sci.space\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"misc.forsale\",\"comp.graphics\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"rec.motorcycles\",\"comp.graphics\",\"sci.space\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"misc.forsale\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"comp.windows.x\",\"comp.windows.x\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"sci.electronics\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"talk.politics.guns\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"comp.windows.x\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"talk.religion.misc\",\"comp.graphics\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.autos\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"alt.atheism\",\"alt.atheism\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"sci.crypt\",\"sci.crypt\",\"comp.graphics\",\"sci.crypt\",\"comp.windows.x\",\"sci.med\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"sci.med\",\"rec.motorcycles\",\"sci.med\",\"sci.space\",\"comp.graphics\",\"rec.autos\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"rec.autos\",\"comp.sys.mac.hardware\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"sci.med\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"sci.crypt\",\"sci.electronics\",\"misc.forsale\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"talk.politics.mideast\",\"rec.sport.baseball\",\"comp.graphics\",\"comp.graphics\",\"soc.religion.christian\",\"sci.space\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"comp.os.ms-windows.misc\",\"comp.graphics\",\"rec.autos\",\"rec.sport.hockey\",\"talk.politics.misc\",\"rec.autos\"]],[\"embed_2d_0\",[0.2557847201824188,-2.8419134616851807,0.5293265581130981,-3.4870262145996094,-0.04870586469769478,-1.314724087715149,-2.4874672889709473,-3.6839218139648438,-3.5742132663726807,-2.01841139793396,-1.4266457557678223,-0.5167613625526428,-2.2175614833831787,1.8502033948898315,0.37339627742767334,0.17941081523895264,-1.4684081077575684,-0.11784827709197998,-4.153513431549072,0.3974825441837311,0.53855961561203,0.9878499507904053,-1.7895036935806274,-0.5278949737548828,-2.288733959197998,-1.8246142864227295,-3.700603485107422,1.8522855043411255,-2.430213689804077,-1.1475340127944946,1.4635282754898071,-0.2932773232460022,-0.4941420555114746,-1.8819169998168945,-2.298394203186035,-0.37471330165863037,-4.481906890869141,-3.4709911346435547,0.5331771373748779,-2.634636878967285,1.607668161392212,-4.394791603088379,-3.021047592163086,-2.5537269115448,-1.825395941734314,-2.3015286922454834,-0.1488550454378128,-4.087502956390381,-4.387163162231445,-1.2398566007614136,-2.2017035484313965,-1.9103021621704102,-2.104396343231201,-3.19162917137146,0.12736274302005768,-2.632988691329956,1.4219622611999512,-4.070578098297119,-4.39936637878418,-2.667902946472168,-3.518080949783325,-1.5277527570724487,-3.195185422897339,1.00605309009552,-0.7509369850158691,-2.3423030376434326,-4.16460657119751,-1.4353001117706299,-0.6925373077392578,-1.364854335784912,-4.607959270477295,-0.7679581046104431,-2.649916172027588,-2.05436635017395,2.183955430984497,-2.1438722610473633,-0.4163890779018402,-4.379300594329834,-0.11245357990264893,0.5121771693229675,-2.3077731132507324,-2.2526516914367676,-2.2968714237213135,1.8809908628463745,1.7701150178909302,-4.332459449768066,-2.5995709896087646,0.10306498408317566,0.017113396897912025,-4.4599995613098145,-4.6517839431762695,0.34721794724464417,2.5796830654144287,0.11311549693346024,2.975144386291504,-0.3065219223499298,-4.462518692016602,-2.056222677230835]],[\"embed_2d_1\",[0.8259609937667847,1.8475600481033325,2.899261951446533,3.6067893505096436,1.7055375576019287,2.68494
