The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)

I do not believe that RSA would consent to such.    However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or maximum modulus size.    It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose all of its motives and intentions.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:  HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release offers:  - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake        and its config files on your site. I have tried to        provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable        for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely        tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you        have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma        release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude        of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS  Ftp:  Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.  Note:  Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings.  E-mail:  Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.\",\": >So, by going mailorder through Gateway, I save ~13%.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or what but I want to go to a color machine.

As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).\",\"Hi!

Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.

To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:              (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.

Source: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992  MASSACRE UNCOVERED....  By ANATOL LIEVEN,  More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have  been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims  that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.  Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley  and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's  massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.  From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of  Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters  of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their  own lines.  We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last  troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.  They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,  who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert  to ease their departure.  A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their  dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the  same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian  positions.  In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another  31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures  do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed  the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also  do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies  Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200  people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came  by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and  of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies  we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.  The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.  All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly  clothing of workers.  Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national  volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,  including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,  APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED  IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

Covey\\\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \\\"Armed Force.\\\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \\\"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\\\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically. \",\"  The VESA standard can be requested from VESA:  VESA  2150 North First Street, Suite 440  San Jose, CA 95131-2029   Ask for the VESA VBE and Super VGA Programming starndards.

What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid.\\\" He added: \\\"What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination.\\\"  Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said \\\"We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States.\\\"  \\\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights. Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are not hired to the government offices.\\\"  \\\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career.\\\"  \\\"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk.\\\"  \\\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\\\"  In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example, he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki) and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes, they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including the Turkish candidates.  Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947. He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.  In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures.   Serdar Argic\",\"I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option known as \\\"differential ready\\\".

No. RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to 8 I think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages. PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn't cut in PRK, it vaporizes. In RK, the eye is cut into.

This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason to believe it still goes on.  Read this:  From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992  PUBLICATION BAN          The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many         years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were         sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of         their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever         being made public.  By Baruch Me'iri  All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way or another: \\\"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published\\\".  The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.  In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison, for security offenses, in complete secrecy.  In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA] affair -- we heard about \\\"the third man\\\" being in prison.  But many years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former Communist countries.  But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.  The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:  \\\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner\\\", asserts MK Zucker.  On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \\\"There is absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public.  \\\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\\\"  Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question.  \\\"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret\\\", wrote Zucker.  The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that, \\\"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned, and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter\\\".  \\\"The Union is aware\\\", says Shiffman, \\\"of cases where notification of a suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.  \\\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is happy...\\\"  Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible.  \\\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it.\\\"  -- Do you find this situation acceptable?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand, though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least are aware of his imprisonment.\\\"  -- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the discretion of the court?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which they can misuse.\\\"  -- And what if there really is a security issue?  Attorney Arnon: \\\"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.  Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public.\\\"  Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \\\"A healthy situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security\\\".  A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir.  \\\"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.  \\\"Nevertheless\\\", adds Shtendal, \\\"the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned. The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\\\"  Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \\\"As a rule, clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances.\\\"\",\"Mouseless operation is documented in the man pages for olwm and olvwm... However, I can't get it to work in either.

If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a  modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all  O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\" I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz).

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software.

The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess.  SCSI means \\\"The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2\\\" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.  To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} \\\"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE...\\\" or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} \\\"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...\\\"  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc), antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

Bill Claussen   Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?\",\"I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \\\"Greek Lexicon\\\" renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed \\\"chorion.\\\"   Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:   \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Louw and Nida  \\\"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\\\"  \\\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\\\" Grimm  \\\"Word study Concordance,\\\" Tynsdale  \\\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other    early Christian Writings,\\\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  \\\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\\\" Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:   A space, place, region, district, field, area, \\\"country place,\\\"   land, farm, estate, \\\"a bit of tillage\\\", and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about \\\"grave.\\\" As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into \\\"contradictions\\\" to  be once again, as your friend said it, \\\"lacking in substance,\\\" and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of \\\"agros,\\\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word \\\"agros\\\" is defined as \\\"a field in the country.\\\" Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for \\\"field\\\" in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for \\\"field\\\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the \\\"Potter's Field.\\\"       Later,      Dave Butler\",\" Another person incapable of rational thought!\",\"  True (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).

Nobuya \\\"Higgy\\\" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of   + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of \\\"good\\\" is \\\"whatever God happens to want.\\\" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might \\\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature.\\\")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \\\"Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing.\\\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, \\\"Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?\\\" or even, \\\"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!\\\" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \\\"Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\\\"           The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, \\\"And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\\\" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, \\\"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?\\\" He answered, \\\"If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\\\" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: \\\"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art.\\\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \\\"I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\\\"? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: \\\"If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\\\"  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.\",\" : I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get : 985 KB/s.

Here are the rates I get:  1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec  2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec  3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec  I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like \\\"after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host\\\" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    \\\"Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.\\\"  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    \\\"Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.\\\"  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    \\\"For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers\\\"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???  Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know? \",\"     Yow - get some sleep Brad!  You mean that people (i.e. life-is-cheap terrorists & drug-dealing warlords) who want to communicate in privacy will prefer to break into my house, kill or kidnap me, and steal my telephone, rather than:          - Spending $15 at K-mart to buy a new phone.          - Purchasing a load of phones from the black market / flea market /           super market.          - Talking (*gasp*) face-to-face.          - Walking down to any one of millions of pay phones.          - Using messengers.          - Going to excruciating effort to think of code phrases like \\\"I had           a blowout on the freeway today\\\".

Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don't think we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugs murdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up just to steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  it catches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the \\\"bad guys\\\" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it, and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it.\",\"The headline says it all!!!!!!!! \",\" No.  That these drugs happen to be useful as antidepressants is neither here nor there. \",\"For Sale:        Tektronix 4208 Color Terminal       Tektronix 4510A Rasterizer       Tektronix 4692 InkJet Printer        Tektronix 4692 Printer Extras (all Tektronix products):          Paper (> 3 boxes)         Transparencies (> 2 boxes)         Maintenance Cartridges (2 cart)         Magenta Ink Cartridge (1 cart)    We would like to sell as a single lot, and preference   will be given to offers for the entire list.

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.  I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.  The problem is that my top level frame created as  frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL); seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.  I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code :  XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame;  win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);  /* So far so good */  colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);  /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */  attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);   Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?  Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.  2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII.  3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last  four years.  The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the  Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians.   For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people  lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the  oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried  out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks  and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their  homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands  were empty of Turks and Kurds.   The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and  Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.  Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated  by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against  humanity.  x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide  against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations  to the Turks and Kurds.  Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine  their own future as a nation in their own homeland.  During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Serdar Argic\",\"[deleted] []       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better []armed if you want to hit what you aim at. []  Define \\\"armed better\\\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull   the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again   to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an   easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often   lost as you realize \\\"hey, it's jammed!\\\" before starting to do anything   about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the    chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed   of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of   operation of many of them requires more training.  Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \\\"semi-autos are junk\\\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they          introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. \",\"From the \\\"JPL Universe\\\" April 23, 1993  Cosmologist Stephen Hawking tours Lab\",\"  Other people have commented on most of this swill, I figured I'd add a few comments of my own.

But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the \\\"Reciprocal System\\\", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) \\\"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\\\"                      (2) \\\"The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\\\"                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called \\\"UNIT VELOCITY\\\" and \\\"THE NATURAL            DATUM\\\").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson's lack of a fancy \\\"PH.D.\\\" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a \\\"unified field theory\\\" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      \\\"Modern physics\\\" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that \\\"epicycles\\\", \\\"crystal spheres\\\",            \\\"geocentricity\\\", \\\"flat earth theory\\\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson's organization, \\\"THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\\\", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal \\\"RECIPROCITY\\\".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   \\\"Super Collider\\\" BOONDOGGLE!

It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \\\"scientific\\\"            value.                      Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (\\\"mesons\\\", \\\"hyperons\\\", ALLEGED \\\"quarks\\\", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of \\\"fire ants\\\" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the \\\"Supercollider\\\"?!                                 Naming the \\\"Super Collider\\\" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls \\\"Unit Velocity\\\" and the \\\"Natural Datum\\\".                       In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help \\\"prove\\\" Einstein's \\\"General Theory of Relativity\\\".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \\\"General Relativity\\\" can, by            INSTEAD using \\\"SPECIAL Relativity\\\".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \\\"General Relativity\\\" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \\\"Special            Relativity\\\", including the parts about \\\"mass increases\\\" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term \\\"COORDINATE TIME\\\" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to \\\"mass increases\\\", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called \\\"Big Bang\\\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \\\"THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION\\\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the \\\"3-degree\\\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory's success:            In his first book in 1959, \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE\\\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from \\\"neutron stars\\\" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the \\\"Cosmic Sector\\\".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\"            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by \\\"fusion\\\".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the \\\"MAIN SEQUENCE\\\" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \\\"degenerate matter\\\", \\\"neutron            stars\\\", \\\"black holes\\\", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \\\"mini\\\" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode's Law.                         \\\"Black Hole\\\" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \\\"black            holes\\\" merging together into a SINGLE \\\"black hole\\\", and            concluded that the new \\\"black hole\\\" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original \\\"black holes\\\".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \\\"black            holes\\\", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book \\\"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\\", it is            clear to me that \\\"black holes\\\" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \\\"black            hole\\\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to \\\"prove\\\" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical            problem somehow makes him \\\"wiser\\\".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book \\\"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\\\", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      \\\"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \\\"NOTHING BUT            MOTION\\\"] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\\\"                            Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the \\\"unit\\\" rate).             (\\\"Unit velocity\\\" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \\\"above\\\" and            \\\"below\\\" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the \\\"unit\\\" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book \\\"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\\\".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            \\\"science\\\" (or \\\"physics\\\", or \\\"astronomy\\\", etc.), as well as            the \\\"scientific\\\" literature and the \\\"education\\\" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                      Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it \\\"infallibilism\\\".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.\",\"  DUDE!

I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the \\\"great judgement\\\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \\\"soul\\\" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people \\\"sleep\\\" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different \\\"technology\\\" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.\",\"   They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are incorrect (see below).   No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX) should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.   There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses. Your file should look like this:  137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver> 137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>   Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.   Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also, but  apparently they don't.   Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address.  It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.  Hope it helps, Richard \",\"    100% Israeli citizens.  The ethnic composition depends on what you mean by formed.  What the UN deeded to Israel?  What it won in war?     Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine? Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.     And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class citizens.     Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land they bought.    You know, Sam, when people start talking about an International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like anti-Semitic bull.   The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple. Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National home for the Jews.    [...]   Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant) International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group. The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic states?   I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?     How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

Wouldn't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16. How about the other guns?

I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools, do you still think that just believing is enough?'  Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith. But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.  Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do) as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'  Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper- work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the Nagorno Karabagh region.  After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \\\"uprising\\\" in Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a  demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even  women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here,  and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site. I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew  wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really  bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me, \\\"There's unrest everywhere, be careful.\\\" Well I had a project going on. I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they  said, \\\"Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the  police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\\\"  Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us, too.  I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \\\"The situation is very tense, be careful.\\\"  We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it  and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus,  they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait.  I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the  buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \\\"Let's go find some other way to get there.\\\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait.  He took us there. But the others had said, \\\"I wouldn't go if you gave me a thousand rubles.\\\" \\\"Why?\\\" \\\"Because they're burning the city and killing the Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left.\\\" Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we  set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \\\"In fact there aren't any Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\\\" Well  I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me,  \\\"How old are you, old man?\\\" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not  saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. \\\"How old are you?\\\" he asks  me. I say, \\\"I'm 47.\\\" \\\"I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'.\\\" I say, \\\"It  depends on God, each person's life in this world is different.\\\" I look much older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was silent, too.  We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon. Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us.  I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature  shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .  Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's  not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak  their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for  \\\"nut,\\\" or \\\"little nut,\\\" as \\\"pundukh,\\\" but \\\"fundukh\\\" is actually correct. The  pronunciations are different. Anyone who says \\\"pundukh,\\\" even if they're not  Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says,  \\\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\\\" he says. \\\"They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the people out,\\\" he says, \\\"they wouldn't let them get out of the car.\\\" I only saw  the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back . . .  When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy, his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \\\"We're Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here.\\\" He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says, \\\"Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?\\\"  But in Azerbaijani I say, \\\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\\\" And . . . he  left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had  to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own  home.  They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store  and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I  saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I  couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing  remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About 30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.  I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots. Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier.  Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning  off Sumgait.  I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by  their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see. But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly  recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block. I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as  to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking  behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: \\\"Comrades, the Armenian- Azerbaijani war has begun!\\\"  The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around  the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off  behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings,  and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were  doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But  the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least find out if my children were alive or not . . .

I purposely used \\\"handle\\\" in order to  avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like \\\"scientific\\\" creationism).  I used \\\"best\\\" in part to indicate  that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \\\"how and when\\\".  Nobody seems to argue over what.   Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works. On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I  think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are  incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to  be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore  it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for  dispensing answers to \\\"who and why\\\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of  the \\\"truth\\\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.   In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \\\"real\\\" as scientific facts and  explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).     No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals.  Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was  created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might  presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued  that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not  explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words,  I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific  as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but  I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will  be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty  convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.     I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how,  when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment,  reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when,  and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the  naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely  leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.    Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will  [FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in  [FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation.   Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and  depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?  [FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not  [FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will  [FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia.

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb  [FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases  [FARID] regarding the potential of Iran).   So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.  [FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's  [FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it.   Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are a damn fool, Farid!

In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:  The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \\\"F\\\" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.   Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.   That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about our hobby.   True.

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at  21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks. Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are wrong.  By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as California, declined to do so.

Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this.

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.   I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard. Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)

Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.\",\" False, as federal courts have affirmed on many occasions.

Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been behind it.  What's going on here?  Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next. I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being consumed in the apocalypse.  IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations. They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles, obstensibly to perform \\\"gas insertions\\\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push him over the edge.  Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning) claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the \\\"gas insertion\\\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.  Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.  The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back, abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to show the world how big her balls are.  Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

I am familiar with    the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally    I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.    If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do    fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is    a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI's:   - Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess    I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a    computer with one hand and use the other for holding something    like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my    favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be    done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,    searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I    need to use both hands for is entering text.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word \\\"homosexuality\\\", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as \\\"wanton\\\", and that another may be specifically \\\"male prostitute\\\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that \\\"strange flesh\\\" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...\",\"For those who are interested in Ray Traced pictures, there is a nice example on alt.binaries.pictures.misc.

Be that as it may....  Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.  This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown much power yet, though.  How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.  In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?  A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.  Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the \\\"in the field\\\" part, and I think he'll be better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs, Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).   See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500 is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like \\\"could run away with the division\\\" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

Even if we assume that these \\\"trusted agents\\\" are really entering  a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the  time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not  doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry  at carefully selected points to encode data.  They would presumably be  punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program  the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they  are feeding into the system.  S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.  Nope, it can't be trusted.

Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.)   The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost,  almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty,  especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.   Oooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.  Similarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.  Also, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you include that?   The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the rules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong with that?

Does anone have any information  I'm not sure that this condition is \\\"recognised\\\" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these \\\"acute\\\" changes in a \\\"chronic\\\" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints).\",\" Didn't you read the instructions first??

Ex20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or daughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who is within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.

On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.\",\"TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse  and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.   If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?   Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.   They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away  again.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  \\\"Demand and supply balance will collapse\\\" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.

Thanks,  -Glen Anderson\",\" Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases.   But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,  to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.   My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how*  you come about developing it.   Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic  assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  \\\"the old Newtonian model of the world\\\".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical \\\"world view\\\".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.    Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa- tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually  found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \",\" I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.\",\"   Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the PowerLink DeskNet.

Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope. Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes, and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\",\"Does any one know of any shareware/freeware software which lets one display EPS files on a PC with DOS and/or Windows???

are atheists atheists/ believes it could be the result of \\\"brokenness\\\"]   i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't share your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope to get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.   well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort of \\\"anti-belief\\\" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that sense of \\\"difference\\\", however, when they are associated with \\\"those weird televangelists who always talk about satan\\\".  if you'll excuse the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist could be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.   you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers to those questions, it is weak and untrue.    in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you \\\"chose\\\" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your choice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or not gay people \\\"choose\\\" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this newsgroup]   i'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?  [moderator points out that many/ most atheists aren't \\\"hostile\\\", they just cease believiing in xiantiy/ religion]   ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an open heart -- including people of \\\"our own camp\\\" with whom we completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith, nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity, not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....   vera noyes\",\"Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative. For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys. (Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement capabilities.)      Any comments?\",\" \",\"     Mr. Hernandez \\u00d1-       I apologize for the misunderstanding.  I explained that I know that it is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them elsewhere.  I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the games have been completed.  However, like I said earlier, I don't think it is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others have come to practice.\",\"I AM Satan!  \",\"Has anyone ever heard of FET-TRONS (or is it FETRONS, FETTRONS, ...). These were FET replacement modules for vacuum tubes. I'm looking for applications where they were used. \",\" No, there is something called the \\\"Delany Amendment\\\" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.  This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are banned.  This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good, and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.  If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect.\",\"  Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US Government?  Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you? The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?  If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you?   Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church  stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation and made it all null and void..   What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble.. Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason or another, but who will give you a \\\"home\\\".. Such as Saudia Arabia or whatever.. There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it.. Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it. The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will not care..  If your worried about the US, do the same thing..  Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what ever.. Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to piss off..

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ? ------------------------------------  While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the Gazans.  The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.  While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.  The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors.  As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for the Master Race.  The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators.  As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve ?  I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to \\\"weapon.\\\" The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going  ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.        Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have changed significantly between 1986 and 1987. \",\"Has ANYONE who has ordered the new PC version of Imagine ACTUALLY recieved it yet?

For that I was planning to get a backpack/rucksack.  The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12\\\" high) and was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.  Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?  Taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully loaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to  be very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load  clinging to the back rest. If I really secure it, with no shifting,  do I still increase my chances of surfing?

That's the point, after all.   That's because these \\\"peer-reviewed\\\" studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models. You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument with a statement like \\\"noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its use in humans.\\\"  This is precisely NOT what you said.   It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of glutamate involve more than \\\"food science\\\".   So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.   Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood.   Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this \\\"projected safety margin\\\" is a construct derived from animal models and given that, you can \\\"prove\\\" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.   You mean \\\"asserting\\\".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the \\\"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\\\".  It says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.

Write yourself a minimal \\\"file system\\\" program that is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a directory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.     The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOS system files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage  unit of a \\\"cluster\\\" there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. These dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file system.     Now you have a situation where no encrypted data \\\"appears\\\" on your disk at all :-). \",\"        AH!

Participants who complete the program can earn two semester hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.  The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool to get students excited about learning and interested in science.  Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:      > Living in Space      > The Space Shuttle      > The Space Station      > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society      > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics      > The Solar System  There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by the Planetary Studies Foundation.  The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9 which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June 17.  The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials, continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.

When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen  gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4\\\" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't  been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't be lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs.

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices.  The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They also give an example of how to \\\"emulate\\\" strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent.  The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:   new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25   Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \\\".25\\\".  From reading I thought that what they might actually do is:   new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25   This results in all the coordinates ending in either \\\"0.25\\\" or \\\"0.75\\\"  whichever is closer.

This is akin to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.   In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.  Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.     The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.   This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests. Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.    Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives, friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before.

I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we \\\"graded\\\" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account?  I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.        -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like \\\"even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.\\\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and \\\"Holy Tradition\\\" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.\",\"/(Frank DeCenso) /> />I need to prioritize things in my life, and this board is not all that important />to me.

There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \\\"get 'em in and get 'em out\\\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}\",\" the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions..  i get much stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce by briefly lifting off,  then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger a kickdown) applying throttle.  above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never unlock;  it would kickdown first.  who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic?  i think of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal.  with my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my right foot, while having both hands to steer. \",\"   \",\"  I learned when riding bareback as a kid to \\\"palm-reign\\\", by just  pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn  left - a lot like countersteering.

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1). I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.  Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the      driver for the network card?  Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers      still needed?  Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do      not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy      of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)  Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace      all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current      Win 3.1 files?  Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have      any troubles with the W4WG machines?

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted  as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the \\\"gun owner\\\" column.   Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The \\\"average threat level\\\" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because  they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the  \\\"average threat level in the country\\\" means to a resident there.   Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors  on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the original text, but the story started with one resident calling the  cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a  drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time, unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.  Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane, your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything.   Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.   That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches  on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if -- DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.   You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar, blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the power to enforce your \\\"rights\\\" but you.  Unless you've given up that  power.   Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun  ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T  any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to try to raise their consciousness.   I think we can.  HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a \\\"One  Million Strong!\\\" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.   My understanding is that they \\\"reached\\\" it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they started running a \\\"Two Million Strong!\\\" campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership.  In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.   By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had  about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA). And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical figures from Kukla's \\\"Gun Control,\\\" pp. 61 and 420.)  As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against  hard-core gun banners.  I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members. I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.  Yes, I think we can and will win this one.   I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but, like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.  If you can,  I'm waiting. -- \",\"Tickets midweek are now down to $34.  They will be $25 starting last week in April, or maybe first week in May.

The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.\",\" Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me, your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.  Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they did back then.

Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).    -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer     very much!)\",\"  I suppose ALL media want something to happen, otherwise what would  they report: that's their job.

It is not lenient. End of argument.   And chopping off the hands or heads of people is not lenient either. It rather appears that you are internalized the claims about the legal system without checking if they suit the description.

Have you got any evidence for your probably opposite claims?       A fact, if memory serves. And most will see the connection between the primitive machism in the Orient and in Islam.     As usually you miss the point. Aids is  neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex. Futher, the point is, a very important point, the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS. It is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex. The consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids. Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual.  \",\"       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Is this Tony Esposito?

 The status of the House of Lords today is quite different to its status  in 1789.     Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted. At the time there was no other major country with a representative body. The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution.   After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were  models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period. \",\"                               etc. etc.....        ^^^^^^  ***Sure!!!

You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.   Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \\\"worth\\\" is subjective.     When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as  distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon.  By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \\\"objective worth\\\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a  little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \\\"objective\\\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is  \\\"good\\\") is subjective.  I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the  meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. \",\"I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or  even gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and  the doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placebo  effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine  and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the  medicine?  Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a  medicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees  more improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effect  called?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor  doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than  there is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effects  ever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you in  advance for all replies. \",\"I haven't been following this thread, so appologies if this has already been mentioned, but how about   comp.graphics.3d \",\" Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss  (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).  Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.  I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \\\"the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*\\\"  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (\\\"Sola Scriptura\\\"), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \\\"But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless.\\\" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him  described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that \\\"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\\\" but rather \\\"I know that my redeemer lives!\\\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying \\\"What is truth?\\\" but rather follows Christ, who said, \\\"In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me\\\" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, \\\"If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free\\\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us \\\"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\\\" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed \\\"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\\\" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \\\"This is my body.\\\"  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, \\\"This is my body,\\\" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \\\"For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.\\\"  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching \\\"real presence\\\" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.  This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach, \\\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.

In their names we demand justice.  In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed  de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a  genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The  result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In  the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies  shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy  merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state  policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a  crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the  successful genocide of the Armenians.  Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet... Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of  Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as  \\\"rebels\\\".  Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.  Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims  Armenians were a \\\"threat\\\".  In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of  approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.  Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish population.  The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and property lost as a result of this genocide.

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous years (which I didn't have access to).  The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.   The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a \\\"this is how well he hit *last* year, in major league terms\\\" rating.  So, in essence, he has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.   Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place and last place, but no more.   Sure; they didn't have anyone better.

Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.   CHIP CONTENTS  The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called \\\"Skipjack.\\\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.  Each chip includes the following components:     the Skipjack encryption algorithm    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip  The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the \\\"MYK-78.\\\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron.   ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP  To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.  Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values:     E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and     E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,   which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed.  The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the session key:     D[E[M; K]; K] = M .   CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW  All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at Mykotronx.  At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.    To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a 64-bit block R1:          R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .  Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:            R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]          R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .  R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies.  As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts.    The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies.   The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or both may be independent from the government.   LAW ENFORCEMENT USE  When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder.   CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION  A successor to the Clipper Chip, called \\\"Capstone\\\" by the government and \\\"MYK-80\\\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July. \",\"On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures  the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with  5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish  to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great  that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch  the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor  only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.                    What could the problems be and what else could I use to lower the input voltage?

I have noticed a few problems with the car :   1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like            11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of            gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).   2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something            like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles,             it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm.   I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has done about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/ recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it unless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).  Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.  Thanks.  Regards,  --Sudhi.  --  Sira Gopinath Sudhindranath. email : sudhi@ucs.usl.edu.\",\"       If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.

After reading the text some distinct questions arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?    shorter or longer ?     First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)    Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system- security.    So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such a bad idea ?    Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret, or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \\\"no good\\\" because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England,  Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring  1993 edition):    \\\"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude   those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be \\\"one who doesn't draw   exclusive circles\\\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around \\\"Mormon\\\" or \\\"Christian,\\\" to decide who is \\\"orthodox\\\"   and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ's \\\"orthodoxy\\\" is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.    \\\"I recently spent some time in a \\\"Christian\\\" bookstore in California. The   service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and   well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American   culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \\\"Cults and the   Occult,\\\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).    \\\"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\\\"Perfect   love casteth out fear,\\\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the \\\"religious right wing\\\" has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,   if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.\\\"   The above \\\"sermon\\\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \\\"Christian\\\", if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves.  Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion  and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.   \",\" Hallo POV-Renderers ! I've got a BocaX3 Card.

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans have the right to Clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption. This implies that, ultimately, non-Clipper strong encryption must become illegal.  (As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about \\\"harmonious balance\\\" when they're talking about taking away people's right to communications privacy?)  Although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption is mentioned as well:    It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications, will be distributed only through the \\\"underground\\\".

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \\\"A exist\\\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \\\"A exists\\\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.   A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.     (Deletion)\",\" think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200 quattros are bargains..

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.        Intuitive Graphic Interface   Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast.  This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.        Image Format Compatibility   Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.        Image Analysis & Processing   For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.        Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis   Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.        Easy External Program Interfacing   Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.        Quick Quality Presentation   Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers.  Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?        Software Support & Development    Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.

The main difference between finnish and North- American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though they helped).

What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods mentioned above).  Well, here's my latest followup...

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on \\\"Bob\\\" Kelly's infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \\\"drawing the line\\\" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:  Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly: Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: \\\"is he the one who is to come or do we look for another\\\". (see book of Matthew)   David Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real Messiah when he does show up.   Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  ...    Who else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.\",\"  Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on the 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).   Funny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.     Probably yes. So what ?      Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried \\\"in camera\\\". I wouldn't exactly call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases in camera.    Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze, or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.      Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).    No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)     Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.    The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.   I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

Here are the relevent calls:  main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,                 main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win); The event mask for main_win is:         PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |         EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask; The flags are         PPosition | PSize  I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values): detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg); XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,                 detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint); detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0); XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win); Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.   If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some detail I'm overseeing.

And another has    already fired off a letter of protest to NIST.     My point? I suspect this list, interesting as it is for various    reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.    Some of them, yes. Others, no.   I received mail from Mitch Kapor saying that he did not ask to be on the list, and does not know why he was added.  I'm sure the same applies to others on the list.  So, I guess my initial theory was right, that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke.  I guess I should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy.    Marc\",\"     GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic ped nature.  Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different orientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.  xavier\",\"HP 48SX calculator with 128K card.

I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron (formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard.  I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company.  I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.  Thanks very much in advance for any information. \",\"VHS movie for sale  Kevin Costner Dances withs Wolves  Just open and was used once, $12.00 or best offer, buyer will have to pay shipping.

AA and other 12-step abuse- recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.  Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes  people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God, as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.) == Seanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living, (seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,                                               | God will find his people busy Opinion, what opinions?

X X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language. X    (see \\\"The New Hacker's Dictionary\\\" by Eric Raymond) X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May. X X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.

There is no Open entry on the File menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.  I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice multi-file replacement for Notepad.\",\"I have a  novell 2.0a that I will sell for $692 which can be upgraded to 3.11 for $460.

I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed.

I had drove it for couples times and I think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour. At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me.

Unfortunately, the Braves' pitchers were so bad for so long that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*) on pitching that they completely ignored hitting.   The Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of the mid-seventies.  Heaven help us.  \",\"    Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to \\\"back out\\\" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.     \\\"There is a fear - a real fear, too,\\\" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette. \\\"We have one generation to do it or to die.\\\"     Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where \\\"historical sites\\\" are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians, Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.     \\\"It's important to have an identity,\\\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose, a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \\\"It's important for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.\\\"     For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.     Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity, kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact, Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths, traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton, is \\\"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\\\"     So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India, where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \\\"good deeds\\\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose, the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto, and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted  ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called \\\"fire worshippers,\\\" they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.  \\\"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\\\" Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people came to worship and revel.     \\\"The good things in life are not forbidden,\\\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani, a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \\\"People eat the fruit,\\\" Tarapore said.  \\\"It's a way to participate in the ceremony.\\\"  _Santa Claus, sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \\\"This is all new for us, too,\\\" one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.     \\\"When I first heard about this religion,\\\" he said, \\\"I thought, my God, this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.     \\\"People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the difference with the lower animals?\\\"\",\"#  Actually, I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject # (i.e. the \\\"new, inproved\\\" survey saying that roughly 1% of men are gay) # on the front page of The New York _Times_ recently (I think it was # on Thurs, 15 April).

I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.          (using block-mode transfers) I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can          achieve 6.8 MB/s.  Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.  It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer, then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)  So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer,   Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer. Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer. Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.         ... Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer. Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.  Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously, and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho') each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.  Why?  Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time.) Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use the same bus to mac RAM?  Is there anything I can do?\",\"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden!

This isn't really light pollution since it will only be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the day).  (Of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you're probably going to be inconvienenced. But you're inconvienenced anyway in that case).  Finally: this isn't the Bronze Age, and most of us aren't Indo European; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have much non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. So: please try to remember that there are more human activities than those practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the Priesthood.

One note, testing at high frequency accurately can be an *expensive* business. \",\"  The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining  inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go. But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields, but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.   Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction.    As to retaliation,  It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the  attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against  civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked. Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side. I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions, this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than  Israeli troops.   I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any  further attacks on Northern Israel.     Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better. I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question.     I agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable. \",\"       Nope. The Apple 16\\\" monitor does not support multiple resolutions.

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.  You err  if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion. \",\"OK, I'll join in the fun and give my playoff predictions:   1st round:  ----------  PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4.   WASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6.

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are adjusted to \\\"factory-spec\\\" before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15\\\" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a \\\"perfect\\\" monitor (the definition of \\\"perfect\\\" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my case quite :).   I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC, finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO, but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was \\\"normal\\\"). The short answer is no, don't accept these \\\"imperfections\\\" as \\\"normal\\\" because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and if you're persistent, you'll receive it.  \",\"Hi there!...

I hear the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three, WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer, and neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the catergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the theme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP is totally original.  Their hosts actually have a personality (this is a knock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and Sommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia to the ones in Washington is a total joke.  Anyway, I like the FAN and WIP, but I think the edge goes to 'IP.    When I get back from Philly, I go into withdraw cause Richmond has nada except the national sports line (and those guys are totally clueless)    I was really mad when WCAU was cancelled because they had Steve Fredericks doing sports phone after the Phillies games.  (WCAU is another strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they still have the Phillies) I started listening to the FAN because I heard he went there.  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same guy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back in Philly when I went to see a few Eagles games.     I will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an Eagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are in control right now.   About the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like a book.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran, (when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said that the Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win. Well they were inches shy of pulling the victory.  \",\" By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)  Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).  ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.  I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel.\",\"    >Now let me get this straight.

Weird, eh?\",\"I hear George Bush (remember him?) will receive an honors degree from some Kuwaiti University for contributing to certain Kuwaiti interests not too long ago.  Do you think it would add much to his resume? ;-)    \",\" The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even \\\"hundreds of thousands\\\" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \\\"I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\\\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \\\"not guilty\\\"? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,\",\" Well Sweden and Australia, and lord knows wherever else used to drive on the \\\"wrong\\\" side of the road, so the export market might have been larger then than just the UK.   By the 1920s, there was a very active \\\"good roads\\\" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco \\\"America on the Road\\\" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called \\\"The Devil Wagon in God's Country\\\" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.   Dan dh3q@andrew.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University Applied History\",\" What interpretations?

EDT                     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take  questions today.              Q   George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton  administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the  United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that  the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has  said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously,  this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't  come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look  seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime,  we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in  the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the  negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something  the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the  table.              Q   How much longer are you going to give them to come  to the table, George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.              Q   It's been a long time.              Q   On February 19th, the President mentioned the value  added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by  reporters, he said -- quote -- \\\"That is a radical change in the tax  system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to  look at in the years ahead.\\\"  Questioned again about it later he  says, \\\"It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  It wasn't a trial balloon or  anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a  question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - \\\"Certainly we're looking at a VAT.\\\"  What's gone on?              Q   The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is  reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.   And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not  going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.              Q   But you have also said from this podium time and  time again --              Q   Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.                Q      that that was not under consideration.              Q   Yes.  Clinton says, \\\"It is not something that is  now under consideration.\\\"  Is that no longer true?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms.  Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been  made of any kind.              Q   Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if  it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he  didn't tell us about it or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under  consideration or if it was something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering I'll tell you.\\\"              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?              Q   \\\"If we start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"   That's a direct quote.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a  number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.   The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the  proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and  cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform  the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have  looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of  different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.              Q   Well, is the President aware of their consideration  of this option?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed  on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task  force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that  that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with  the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe  that that's been presented to him, no.              Q   Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him  what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very  deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be  made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point.              Q   If this is still under consideration, that's a  change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about  three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking  about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I  remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that  not the case?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has  been presented to the President as something that is being looked at  at some level in the task force.              Q   It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other  options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled  out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is  being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean,  it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the  decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of  different options.              Q   If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out  now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?              Q   When a guy says in February --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are  looking at the widest possible range of options.              Q   So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it  before; they're looking at it now.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working  groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide  net.              Q   How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able  to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now  are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are  looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --              Q   Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly  ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those  are the President's words.  Those are very clear.              Q   Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny  that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled  it out?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I  think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say  they stand.              Q   So don't they stand any longer?              Q   March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five  years it was ruled out.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President  did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate  track, and as I said, I don't believe --              Q   Separate from the President?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been  presented to the President.              Q   Are they considering something that the President  --              Q   Has ruled out?              Q      has ruled out?  I mean, will the President  consider a VAT tax?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not  presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of  options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly  listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.              Q   Can we put this another way?  In his answer in  Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax  system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it  might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the  case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what  you're asking.              Q   He talked about the VAT in the context of a  restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health  care, for example.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   Or anything else.              Q   It was always in the context of substituting for  other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.              Q   Has that change, too?              Q   Is that still his view?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those  specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the  working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes,  they have.              Q   Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility  of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a  decision?  No, he has not.              Q   What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the  President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his  ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line  reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has  specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then  goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the  President concerned about that sort of thing?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's  concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal  possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most  thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the  different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with  something like that it's certainly something the President will  explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those  lines.              Q   What does it mean exactly, though, when the  President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the  table later if a more persuasive argument is made?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably  true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He  has not made a proposal.              Q   What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open  to it before?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to  the argument.              Q   Was he willing to listen to the argument for a  short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in  Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was  that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not  something he was proposing, not something he was floating.              Q   Not something he was considering.  Those are his  words -- \\\"It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we  start considering it, I'll tell you.\\\"  You're now acknowledging, are  you not, that it is under consideration and --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task  force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the  President has not made a decision on it.              Q   But the door is open for the President to  reconsider including this as part of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are  looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.              Q   Do you know if they will make a presentation on  behalf of the VAT to him?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that  if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know  that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they  should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups  are looking at.              Q   Do you understand, George, that none of us are  asking these questions in context of a decision that the President  has made, only about what the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am  acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a  VAT.              Q   And the President will consider it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the  argument if it is presented to him.              Q   Does that mean the President -- that working groups  think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working  groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.              Q   George, can I ask you another question about  Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he wants us to stay on this.              Q   Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)              Q   No, he got out of that swamp.              Q   I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.   Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said  that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked  out -- quote -- \\\"We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the  arms embargo together with our allies.\\\"  That seems to go a bit  further than what you've just said --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just  said.              Q   Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept  what Reggie --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that  this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he  will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the  table.              Q   Isn't there some kind of timetable here?                MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's  going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.              Q   That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the  sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.   And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope  that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr.  Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also  working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to  pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option  as well.              Q   The question is whether there's a timetable for  consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo,  not the sanctions.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on  sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting  the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both  internally and with our allies.              Q   Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the  U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is  something that's under consideration, and this is something that we  take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should  know the consequences of failing to come to the table.              Q   Have they been given a deadline?              Q   Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing  and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why  should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo  when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the  fighting in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of  your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an  effect.                Q   What effect?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed  our warnings, then they will face the consequences.              Q   What effect has it had in Bosnia?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on  the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their  shipments through.  We can brief more fully --              Q   In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it  had?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's  stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to  press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we  will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.   I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't  happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can  weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come  to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.              Q   Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th  -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the  United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if  the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that  we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going  to --              Q   But on that deadline?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but  we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution,  by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails  to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other  actions.              Q   Isn't this awfully incremental?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step  approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to  continue to do that.              Q   Is there a possibility, George, that by the time  all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved  their goals and then what's the purpose?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the  Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many  different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're  pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through  tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms  embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will  continue to do that.              Q   But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in  getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any  campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean,  once they're entrenched --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're  going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're  going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't  see into the future.              Q   George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans  say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to  try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which  show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.   What's your strategy to counter that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one  we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up  the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package  will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner  cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point  out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.   We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to  point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the  Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or  they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.               Q   Does it concern you, though, that the House now,  the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against  it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.              Q   George, does it strike anybody in the  administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President  did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- \\\"a  reaffirmation of a promise of America\\\"?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the  promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full  potential.               Q   Government-funded jobs?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?   Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.              Q   I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday  -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at  it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This  will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.              Q   The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus  package?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.              Q   Where does that number come from?  Because we've  been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000  new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something  like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when  you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will  receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time  job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.              Q   Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --              Q   One to four because it's three months.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.              Q   Can I follow up on that?  Did the President  misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money  for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the  private sector?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think  that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you  pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to  the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.                Q   Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to  work at Time-Warner?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually  somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to  be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where  there would be grants to businesses.              Q   Has the President spoken with any Senate  Republicans this week?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the  White House.              Q   At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.              Q   Getting any closer to get the votes?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.               Q   Anybody leaning your way?              Q   On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting  something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup  leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what  impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to  say yesterday in his report?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.   I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would  leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has  returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White  House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time  again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a  final resolution to a broader political settlement.              Q   George, yesterday you offered some selective  breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.   Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be  impacted?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states,  yes.  And I think we can get it out.              Q   Could you make that generally available?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.              Q   And could you do it by the component of the  stimulus?  In other words --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know  that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how  deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into  summer jobs and other jobs.              Q   And can I follow up?  Is this the information that  Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the  states?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but  they're press releases.              Q   Can you describe what those press releases contain?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the  benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know  that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.   And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package  creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New  Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that  this is important.               Q   Where are the releases going?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.              Q   To whom?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.              Q   Can we get it?              Q   Why don't you put them out here as well?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.              Q   This afternoon?  Would that be possible?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.   But as soon as we can.              Q   Are you focusing these press releases on states  where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many  as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and  we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.              Q   Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's  schedule?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.               Q   Are press releases going along to states where he's  visiting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that  probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)              Q   Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?   (Laughter.)              Q   George, as the President goes about the business of  defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what  seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with  deficit spending rather than \\\"if it's so important, why not come up  with the funding for it\\\" seems to be the Republican argument.  And  how do you answer that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying  for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this  package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs.              Q   You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add  to the deficit this year?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over  time.  I didn't say that.              Q   I know that, George.  But I mean, from the  beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But  over time our budget fully pays for this program.              Q   What you're saying is that there are savings that  would cover this if it were this year in future years?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I  said.              Q   I know that, but there is going to be outstanding  debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by  $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.              Q   You mean you're reducing it below what it would  have been?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.              Q   In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the  national debt over the period of --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from  what it would have been.  That's true.                Q   Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)              Q   You're getting to be a grumpy old man.              Q   George, has any decision been made about the White  House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming  up in a week and a half?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's  schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic  retreat in Jamestown that weekend.              Q   Will he address it by phone?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a  little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.              Q   So will he have the leaders in a day or two before  the speech?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that  at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.   I don't know the schedule on it, though.              Q   Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in  conjunction with the event?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.              Q   April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President  going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign  the biodiversity treaty that day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on  the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but  I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around  then.              Q   Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie  McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't  know exactly what.              Q   When is Earth Day?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.              Q   Why is it you know that he is going to have a  statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a  statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going  to meet or when he's going to meet.              Q   Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't  be surprised if he did, though.              Q   Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and  the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of  issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and  the trade issues between the two countries.              Q   There was some expectations that a second aid  package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if  I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status  on that?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on  and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked  about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to  continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.              Q?     We will not then make any kind of announcement  during the two-day meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.                Q   Is that when you're going to make one?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.              Q      the President's going to announce it tomorrow.              Q   Bentsen said that.              Q   Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.              Q   So did Christopher.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I  believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of  Tokyo.              Q   George, has there been further consideration here  about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's  not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.              Q   George, you all have a position or do you support  Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United  States?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.              Q   George, there was a report today about the --              Q   Fortunately.  (Laughter.)               Q      about the pace of appointments and says that  President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions  that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the  pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's  appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147  noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's  about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along  farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a  multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect  the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously  we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.                I would point out that the FBI background checks and the  background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time  than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're  working on it.              Q   Is that because of Nannygate?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of  it, yes.              Q   In the story this morning, you were at  approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way  behind in winning confirmations.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks  comes into play.  That's the problem.              Q   That's the background checks problem?  Because I  mean, you have a Democratic Senate --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the  appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all  the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where  the problem is.              Q   What's the President doing this afternoon, and  what's on the plan for tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just  office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of  issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then  he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on  the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And  Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.              Q   Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow,  George?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.              Q   Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the  Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but  we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these  visits.              Q   Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you  know what that was about?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group  of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.              Q   Who?              Q   Reverend Jackson.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty,  me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.               Q   Talking about Haiti?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban  policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from  Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going  on to Los Angeles.              Q   Did he request the meeting?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual  contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of  issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.              Q   George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords  tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at  all on this?        MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact,  sure.              Q   Can you tell us about the contacts?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --               Q   Do you know who contacted him or what was said?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to  him and they just has a general talk about the package.              Q   And did he express his support for it now, or is he  --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the  conversation, but there have been conversations.              Q   The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care  package.  Is this something the President is considering?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --              Q   Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's  been looked at, but no decisions have been made.              Q   What was the question?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether  abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.              Q   Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your  meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice  about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of  the verdict in L.A.?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the  situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic  development and other issues.              Q   For instance, did you discuss whether it would be  helpful for the President to go there or not?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of  issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.              Q   Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in,  I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.              Q      your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments  that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard  on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue  to do that.              Q   Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your  talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't  have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20  people or --              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've  talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.                Q   Anyone leaning your way?              MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just  going to keep working through Tuesday.              THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END                    1:10 P.M.

If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.\",\"On a slightly different note:  There are two buildings in NY state with big 666 numbers on the roof :)  One in Manhattan and one near Garden City.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \\\"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\\\", in   \\\"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\\\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  \\\"Displays on Display\\\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \\\"Jim Blinn's Corner\\\" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it\\\"    \\\"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \\\"  [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called \\\"GVLware\\\".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\\\" A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new \\\"canonical\\\" source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   \\\"tar\\\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different \\\"industry standard\\\"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The \\\"PCI software\\\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \\\"PCI   database\\\" disk file.  The \\\"Tape I/O\\\" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \\\"PCI database\\\" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   \\\"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\\\"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \\\"parameters,\\\" read from   a common \\\"parameter file\\\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \\\"default   directory.\\\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls \\\"raw\\\") data from tape, in a number of different   \\\"interleave\\\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's \\\"CT2T\\\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \\\"database\\\" file is designed to   contain not only \\\"raster\\\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI \\\"database\\\").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI \\\"database\\\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \\\"overkill\\\"   in your case; it seems designed for the very \\\"high end\\\"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

However, I'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding.  As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his \\\"breakthrough\\\" year (for him) last year, so he didn't really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli. I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.  As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.  --  Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com HP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\",\"   Not the first.

This will probably involve defining \\\"spritual needs\\\" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that \\\"fulfilling spiritual needs\\\" means \\\"acknowledging a \\\"higher power\\\" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does, rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me. ---    - Dan Johnson And God said \\\"Jeeze, this is dull\\\"... and it *WAS* dull.

What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]      The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,  where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under  the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,  presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if  a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group  of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and  sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after  drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.     The study received widespread media attention and stirred a  good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.  However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers  did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did  actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not  necessarily go hand in hand.     In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining  the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.  And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the  Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins  University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-  sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in  the amount of food eaten afterward.      One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing  cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a  host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government  has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing  everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.  Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and  after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm  that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the  Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with  monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's  Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration  have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a  clean bill of health.     Granted, the FDA has set forth an \\\"acceptable daily intake\\\" of  50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed  the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take  in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of  aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,  or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...  A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams  of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups  of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content  of selected foods omitted]     Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away  from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called  phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000  to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential  amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child  consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause  such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with  PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other  aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \\\"Phenylketonurics:  Contains Phenylalanine.\\\" \",\"  Maybe I should point out that we are not talking about c.s.amiga.*.

I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.

At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows   of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is   not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by   Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble   in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned   out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of   deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent   away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.      Minister of the Interior,        Talaat\\\" [6]  In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and \\\"rationalizing\\\" this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:   \\\"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for   its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks   it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I   shall die for it.\\\" [7]   These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never questioned these \\\"death march orders\\\" until 1986, during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.  For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.  If one were to examine the sample \\\"authentic text\\\" provided in the Turkish  Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it  too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the  Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or  Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery.   Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul, Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide  architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a  heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.  This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian.     - - - references - - -  [1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60  [2] ibid, page 60  [3] ibid, page 60  [4] ibid, page 61  [5] ibid, page 61  [6] ibid, page 62  [7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and     London), 1926, page 387  \",\"Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of  my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least  favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a  great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.  Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I believe the Cardinal pitching  staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the difference.

What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)    comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu\",\"I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.  Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.  LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.  Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya.  The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.  This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one month.

Here are the highlights:       R    H   E                  Oakland  2    9   0       Detroit            3    7   1  Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the  bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).  The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run.  John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.  In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.  Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:                  WOOF!      Go Tigers!\",\"Can someone tell me in 25 words or less how to compile posix message catalogs so that I can use them with catgets, catopen, etc. I know what the format for the catalogs is, but don't know how to compile them.

As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word \\\"believe\\\" to mean.  Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the \\\"weak atheist\\\" position, and the latter as \\\"strong # atheism\\\". #  # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \\\"Weak # atheism\\\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \\\"Strong # atheism\\\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.

He threw 2 straight fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd, when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.       The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.         The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck. I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

The latest freely-available XGKS can be obtained from  xgks-request@unidata.ucar.edu; this is a 2c implementation derived from the  X11R4 contrib XGKS from IBM and the University of Illinois. The release is on unidata.ucar.edu [128.117.140.3] as pub/xgks.tar.Z. [12/90]  In addition, Grafpak-GKS is available from Advanced Technology Center (714-583-9119).  GKSUL is available from gks@ulowell.edu (ULowell CS department). It is a 2b implementation which includes drivers for a variety of devices. It can be  passed an X window ID to use. The package includes both C and Fortran bindings.  [11/90; from dsrand@mitre.org and from stew@hanauma.stanford.edu]   An XgksWidget is produced by Neil Bowers (neilb@leeds.dcs;  neilb@dcs.leeds.ac.uk); the latest [10/91] conforms with the new version of  XGKS (2.4). It is available on export in contrib/xgks-widget.tar.Z.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  85)  Where can I get an X-based PEX package?   The first official release of PEX is with X11R5; fix-22 brings the Sample Implementation server to version 5.1.   The final PEX 5.1 Protocol specification is now available via anonymous ftp to export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), in the directory /pub/DOCS/PEX/.  Changes made from the Public Review draft are listed in the file \\\"5.1P_changes\\\" in that directory. [9/92]   The final PEXlib 5.1 document is on export in pub/DOCS/PEXlib. [11/92]   There is now available from the University of Illinois an  implementation of the PEX 4.0 specification called UIPEX. It contains a \\\"near- complete\\\" implementation of PHiGS and PHiGS PLUS. The file  pub/uipex/uipex.tar.Z is on a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1); the porting platform was an RT running 4.3.  Questions and comments can to go uipex@cs.uiuc.edu.    In addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is  available on export as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  86)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?   The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive  sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu (128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that  machine. The distribution all includes \\\"mftobdf\\\" which converts PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X server.   The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is  also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu; current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?   X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported  client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier  version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also in the R5 distribution.  In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages).  If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.  In addition:   xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin  Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in  contrib/xproof*.  [8/90]   Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified  troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.   SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards  compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by  AT&T's own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).  [information from Ian Darwin, SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90]   Image Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff  package, which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of  X11-based page previewers. (This is the package OEM'ed by several hardware  vendors.)

A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates   \\\"Wc - Widget Creation\\\" resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.   The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).  Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.    Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a  window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are  or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package  includes an interface builder.         In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X  applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif  look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies.  (1-800-GRAMMI-1).   In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals  of rapid prototyping of the application interface:   WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current [3/93].  WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive  programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or  email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com.   The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without  specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from  ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is  also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent. Email questions can go to serpent@sei.cmu.edu. A commercial version of Serpent is available as \\\"Agora\\\" from ASET, 221 Woodhaven Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15228.  Garnet is a Common Lisp-based GUI toolkit. Information is available  from garnet@cs.cmu.edu.  MetaCard is a hypertext/Rapid Application Development environment similar to Apple/Claris Corporation's HyperCard (info@metacard.com). MetaCard  is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.metacard.com, csn.org, or  128.138.213.21.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  89)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts? I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user  is running X.   Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/  area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.  In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu package to comp.sources.x (\\\"v08i008: xmenu\\\") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]  Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]  There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is being worked on and will likely be re-released.  xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/ are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the  simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]  xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from  hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel.tar.Z and may also be found  in the alt.sources archives.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  90)  Where can I get an X-based debugger?   xdbx, an X interface to the dbx debugger, is available via ftp from  export. The current [1/91] version is 2.1 patchlevel 2.  An X interface to gdb called xxgdb is more like xdbx 2.1.2. It is part  of comp.sources.x volume 11 [2/91]; xxgdb-1.06.tar.Z is on export.  mxgdb is a Motif interface to gdb by Jim Tsillas  (jtsillas@bubba.ma30.bull.com); version 1.1.5 was released 1/93.  UPS is a source-level debugger which runs under the X11 and SunView window systems on Sun and DEC platforms. It is available from export  (18.24.0.11) as contrib/ups-2.45.tar.Z (also ups-2.45-to-2.45.2.patch.Z) and unix.hensa.ac.uk (129.12.21.7) in /pub/misc/unix/ups (or try mail to  archive@unix.hensa.ac.uk). [10/92] Unofficial fixes by Rod Armstrong  (rod@sj.ate.slb.com) are on unix.hensa.ac.uk in  /misc/unix/ups/contrib/rod@sj.ate.slb.com.  Also:  MIPS produces a highly-customizable (WCL-based) Visual Debugger.  You should be able to use Sun's dbxtool with its X11/NeWS server.  The CodeCenter (617-498-3000) source-level debugger, available on most major platforms, includes an X-based interface.  AT&T offers the eXamine Graphical Interface, an X11 interface to dbx and C++ dbx for Sun3 and Sun4 and sdb and sdb++ for 386 and 3B2 platforms. Call 1-508-960-1997 or contact examine@mvuxi.att.com for more information.         Solbourne (+1 303-678-4626) offers PDB, its X-based debugger for C, C++ and Fortran.  PDB uses the OI toolkit and runs in either Open Look or Motif  mode.   SCO (info@sco.com) offers dbXtra as part of several development  systems.         Lucid's Energize Programming System, a tightly integrated development environment for C and C++ programs, incorporates a graphical user interface on top of an extended version of gdb.

How can I \\\"tee\\\" an X program identically to several displays?   There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the  simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines.  XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu  (128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the electronic classroom.  XTV is a conference program which can be used to duplicate the \\\"chalkboard\\\" on several displays. Release 1 is available on the X11R5 contrib tapes; a more recent version is on ftp.cs.odu.edu as pub/wahab/XTV.r2.tar.Z.  SHX from Michael Altenhofen of Digital Equipment GmbH CEC Karlsruhe  also does this; it is a \\\"WYSIWIS\\\" (What You See Is What I See) package in the  context of a computer-based learning/training tool to provide online help from remote tutors but is also useful for general window sharing. Information:  shX@nestvx.enet.dec.com.  SHX can be found on export and    gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z,    crl.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z  Modifications to SHX for color mapping and private color allocation by Mark J. Handley (M.Handley@cs.ucl.ac.uk) are on cs.ucl.ac.uk in  car/shX.car.tar.Z.  XTrap is implemented as a server/library extension and can be used to record and then replay an x session.

This FAQ includes information on a number of \\\"gotchas\\\" that can bite  you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on  building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled  separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your  sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at  the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the  xstuff mail server.  In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration includes information on configuring and building X.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?   Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07  may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?   If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with  libdl.a.  Add \\\"-ldl\\\" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to  surround it with \\\"-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic\\\" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES variable, since \\\"syslibs\\\" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual  compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile  the stubs shared.)  [thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?   In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be undefined when building some X11 clients:   _get_wmShellWidgetClass  _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling \\\"-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic\\\" appears to work.   To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please  contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:  Patch i.d.

The patch is on export in [1/93]  contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC? I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.   Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.   Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.   This is from the GCC manual:   On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for   structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument  list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by   reference.   This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet  supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.   The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and  `-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.     Files which need to be compiled using cc include:   server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c    rgb/rgb.c   In addition, several of the \\\"inet_\\\" functions use structs as args or return values:     clients/xhost/xhost.c    clients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error   \\\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.   Fatal server bug! no screens found.\\\"   Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:   #include <sys/ioctl.h>  SIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \\\"missing\\\" defines for  CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?   The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN   However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.  [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1? The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.   Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include  from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line   #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000 The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied  from another distribution.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4? All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:  ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even:  ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c   If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \\\"ldconfig\\\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]  Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using  shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:  1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site.  2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).  3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?   On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display.

Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles  suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.  Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.  There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.   You can obtain information on imake from these sources:  - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X  - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information  - on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake.  - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake  - Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \\\"send imake-stuff help\\\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.  - see \\\"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\\\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.  - German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \\\"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\\\" by Rainer Klute in \\\"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\\\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1.  - The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake.  - Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?   Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5.  export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution.  A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?   If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \\\"xmkmf\\\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:  Undefined:  _XShapeQueryExtension  _XShapeCombineMask   These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.   In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \\\"_XtInherit not found\\\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \\\"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\\\".   What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.   You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.   1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.  2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.    It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem.

I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message:  Undefined:  _XtScrollBarSetThumb  _XtTextSetInsertionPoint  _XtTextReplace   There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?   The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \\\"hints\\\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.    If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.  OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?   You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.   For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?    There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \\\"test just  this one little thing\\\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \\\"Hello World\\\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix.  [3/90]   In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?   The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:  {  Arg args[3];  int i;  int sensitive;  /* oops; wrong data type */  i=0;  XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;  XtGetValues(widget, args, i );  ...  }  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \\\"sensitive\\\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?   You're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.  The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted.  [The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?   Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \\\"new\\\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.   Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday          The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be          little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian          fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.           Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the          Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of          how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25          February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the          surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in          one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were          shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I          also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift          hospital in a string of railway carriages.           Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by          Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov          Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to          his  town.   \\\" So where are the rest?\\\".  Some might have  taken          prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the          mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to          retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of          cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.           One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at          first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting          to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.          But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored          personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend          themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the          forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.           Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken          prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that          troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack          Khojaly. \\\"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\\\"    Serdar Argic\",\"Someone writing anonymously asks:   I *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser degree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.

However, I discovered that she is actually not an Medical Doctor (M.D.) but rather a \\\"Doctor of  Osteopathy\\\" (D.O.).  What's the difference?  I believe the pediatrician *I* went to for many years was a D.O. and he didn't seem different from any other doctor I've seen over the years.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \\\"Black Bears\\\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

Over the last few years I have heard of one case after another of government running completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I intend to put together what I call the \\\"American Horror File\\\": a compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants, and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws, but including any other cases for which I can find decent documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting, red-hot enraged at their government.  The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and print out copies and give them to neighbors.

If so, where? \",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\"  There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins'  season on ABC (WTAE - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening  game against the Devils on Sunday.

The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --  afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal   torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; \\\"eternal death\\\" if you  prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.    I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly  not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed  metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of  course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview   of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it.

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,     and distribution.  Digital immortality.  The basic idea behind \\\"digital immortality\\\" is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be there...and someone will dig them up.     If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is  breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.   Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption... that's what they're here for.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  WHERE?               OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.       141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site     sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite   (you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)  Merely \\\"anonymous FTP\\\" to either site on Internet and change to the appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the \\\"bin\\\" command to make sure you're in binary.  OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North America....the following systems have a substancial supply of OTIStuff...  Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines  CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron  --------------------------------------------------------------   HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?                What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely    photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me (email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received, it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works are also welcome.  OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.   GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to  see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,   you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format.   OTIS also accepts animation files.        When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You  can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of  emailing).  If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send copies to:  The OTIS Project c/o Ed Stastny PO BX 241113 Omaha, NE 68124-1113  I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.   Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named, include those as well.     Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please contact me and we'll arrange things.  If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\\\" disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back. This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP, but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather not have to.  At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to  get a slab-o-OTIS.  As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.   Email me for current archive size and directory.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DISTRIBUTION?  The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the appropriate text files along with the images.     It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.  It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite BBS system....or even just post this \\\"info-file\\\" there.  It would be keen of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  USE?  If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory, you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or full address credit).  You will either find this in the \\\".rm\\\" file for     the image or series of images...or in the \\\"Artists\\\" directory under the  Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have  to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for  you, or give you their contact information.   When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  NAMING IMAGES?  Please keep the names of your files in \\\"dos\\\" format.  That means, keep the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or four digit \\\"code\\\" for the series of images, plus the series number. Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something like:    ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC  Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems.     ----------------------------------------------------------------------   CREATING IMAGE FILES?  When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title, address or other information you'd like people to know.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HMMM?!  That's about it for now.  More \\\"guidelines\\\" will be added as needed. Your input is expected.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS          (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,       or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations       however.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original         image files.  The files will go to the public at large.         It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone       could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.             Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS       takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights       revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to        give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed        electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed            all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is       NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or       broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not        limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,               screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific       permission for this sort of usage.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Remember, the operative term is \\\"stimulate\\\".

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's  added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their  own appetites.   You don't know much about cats, do you?   Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never   understand a cat.  Their tastes are whimsical.

Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;       1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress  18:27                egress   19:30         B-ring ingress  19:51                egress   21:42         C-ring egress   23:00         Saturn ingress  23:59                egress   10:02         B-ring ingress  10:28                egress   12:19         A-ring ingress  12:40                egress   13:43       1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress  21:16                egress   05:08         A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?     To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,   except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with   a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something   to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and again:    please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay\",\"Actually not Jim.  I just said that everyone else seemed to have skimmed by that part and not mentioned it.

We always came home with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.  (If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me toast.:) \",\" No, it isn't.  It is the \\\"X Window System\\\", or \\\"X11\\\", or \\\"X\\\" or any of a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact, doing \\\"man X\\\" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:       The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used      when referring to this software:                                    X                            X Window System                              X Version 11                      X Window System, Version 11                                  X11  There is no such thing as \\\"X Windows\\\" or \\\"X Window\\\", despite the repeated misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have  to say?  With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both  GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)    NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote.   It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various  sorts of hardware.

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.  HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because it's DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.

You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able #to create, however. :-)   IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.

All of the analog electronics are working  fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so  cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any  LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I  am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about  1000-10,000.

Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.  I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole  calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it  for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This  $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,  import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor  chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President  Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:  1:36 P.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.       The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane.       He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound.       This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender.       I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision.       Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.       Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.       I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances.       Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now.       Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided --       Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with --       THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go first and then the other.       Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once.       Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?       THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.       I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side.       I asked a number of questions.  The first question I asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons I was given were the following:       Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be needed in other parts of the country.       Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out.       Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time.       And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.       So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time.       The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance.       Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that today.       Q  Mr. President --       THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.       Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.       There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control.       I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves.  (Applause.)       I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.       But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for that.  So that is where I think things stand.       Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?       THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we should have known?  Is there some other question they should have asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have.       There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves.       Q  Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.       Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought.       Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?       Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?       THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.\",\" The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference?  Apparently! :)  Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up to 160 meg, in any computer.

Do you mean by \\\"omnipotent\\\" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean \\\"being all-powerful\\\" and not \\\"being able to do anything/everything\\\".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily \\\"omnipotent\\\".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to  unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy  of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do \\\"whatever it wanted\\\". The US would simply \\\"never want to interfere\\\" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.

They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  probably become illegal pretty quickly here...  It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.  You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream.  With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.  Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.  At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software (which I don't).  The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip. Economics, I'm afraid.  However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha) and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]\",\"# #From the Santa Rosa (Cal.)

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.

(1992):  _Biological Psychology_. Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont, CA.  Pg. 219.  Reproduced without permission.]    Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors  Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,  Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids  (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well.  Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.  A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We  awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

In some environments (entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX; also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.  I would dearly appreciate   1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window   a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;    2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my   desired colormaps.

She would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).   It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.  She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal.    She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?  ** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm,  coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out.\",\": >Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern;        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable;        (3)  To serve as a \\\"clearing house\\\" for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations;  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three \\\"Program Divisions\\\" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of \\\"EnviroLeague Teams,\\\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \\\"draft\\\" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \\\"EnviroLeague.\\\" ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:        EnviroLeague        P.O. Box 418        Peoria, IL  61651-0418   Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish contact, to receive a diskette (IBM DOS, ASCII) with initial information. --
