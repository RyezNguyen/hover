Do you have any habits that you cannot break? For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?  I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times. That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson. I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the Corolla than the Corolla?   Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy not having a clue about the Bible.       Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.  And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.    The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to  live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's wishful thinking.    Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect.  Is \\\"the world an undesireable place\\\" a doctrine of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship? Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?   Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being  ignorant of the Bible?  Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism. You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \\\"priests\\\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any \\\"ism.\\\"  I follow Christ.   Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?   Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.

In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a game system galled \\\"LaserGames,\\\" similar in many aspects to Photon (tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these things was \\\"shooting galleries,\\\" which is what the lawyers for the opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that LaserGames could not operate in Manchester.    Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context, LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial of operating permission was justified.    If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don't remember it all well enough to even try.

It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase \\\"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\\\" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a \\\"friend of a friend\\\" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\",\" No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.  What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.  I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while, rather than being flushed.  Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process.  Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we aren't entitled to a \\\"peek under the covers\\\" as the Big Kids (NASA, for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

Coming from you it is  a definition, not an assertion:     Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a     believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is    good. Blah blah blah.  That's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To say that something produces only good because it is only good that  it produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And all you're application is saying that it's true if you really  believe it's true.  That's silly.  Conversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under atheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true- don't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.    Like other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and caste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no logical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for example).  To me this is not good.  I see much pain and suffering without any justification, except for the _waving of the hand_ of some inaccessible god.  By the by, you toss around the word knowledgable a bit carelessly. For what is a _knowledgeable believer_ except a contradiction of terms.  I infer that you mean believer in terms of having faith. And If you need knowledge to believe then faith has nothing to do with it, does it?\",\"  I agree, I reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. You think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.

The original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little easier to understand.  (2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago, that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)  Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my pocket on two 8mm tapes.  Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that \\\"can't\\\" is a prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.  With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you need the \\\"master key\\\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information that have to be stored an awful lot of places.  Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left unexplained by those that point out this threat.)   Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.  Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on the escrow databases.  We crypto types are all taught something very important at the beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million Clipper chips.  I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can try to delay things as long as possible.  Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe that this scheme might give people some security, even as their subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of it all.  -- Perry Metzger  pmetzger@shearson.com\",\"*** NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE ***                                  92-93 SEASON                              HOME ATTENDANCE REPORT   Each Qtr. represents 10 home games,   Qtr. 4 will have 11 home games.

WHY?  I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it, and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even  suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda,  as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests for sufficient fire power.   Important dates:  Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban. Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.      On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent  on \\\"Street Stories\\\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \\\"get  ready fast\\\", as \\\"they know we are coming\\\". I believe this attack continued,  even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top  down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.\",\"  If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function.

Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.  If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.  Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again. (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which you have to XOR together to recover the program...  Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys. If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem, no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.  That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to a Senator...).   I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do. However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure, they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.  I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.

Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get : across what is going on here. :  :  I don't know anything specifically, but I have one further anecdote. A colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease, tuberous sclerosis. Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder. The parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was a meal with corn in it. I have always wondered about the connection, and further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures. Other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters. \",\"The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The \\\"grading\\\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \\\"...who can know it.\\\" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us. \",\" Nor mine, either of them!\",\"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and  `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, \\\"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\\\"  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh balls.:-))   I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \",\"You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).

(Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not.  Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.  I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)   \\\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and   \\\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son\\\"  -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.   \\\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both.\\\"  -St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary.  In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above.  As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \\\"to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.\\\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.   \\\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it.\\\"  -St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)   \\\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\\\"  -Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)   \\\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation....  \\\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created.\\\"  -St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)   \\\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources.\\\"  -St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)   Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the \\\"proceeds from the Father\\\" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.\",\" This makes 5! It IS SPRING!   Neither were we.

She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are: Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in  pet food?  ----------------------------------- I speak for myself and not Motorola -----------------------------------  \",\"  Maine 5, LSSU 4.  \",\"It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear shaped than globular/spherical.

PC World, December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money. I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your library.  I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:   The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:  checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile  your account statements with the records the program keeps.   The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that  budget.   A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill  paying service to pay your bills via your modem.    The ability to print checks on your printer.   The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.   The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts  up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically  via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.   The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation  programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:   A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to  predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine  tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.   An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep  records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.  It can also compute your life expectancy.   A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,   effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to  maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and  loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you   decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford  a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good  investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether  a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.  This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping  your kids with their tuition.     A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets  and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this   information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules  are automatically included here.   A \\\"desk\\\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file  you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital  information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a  rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment  list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to  track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list  can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.

President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press (Part 2 of 2):       Go ahead, Sarah.       Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion?       THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them.       Q  What federal laws --       THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.       They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected.       In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.       MS. MYERS:  Last question.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --       Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments?       THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.       What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know.       Thank you.       Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her.       She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have.       Thank you.

Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name:  XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);   and in the eventhandler do a:    while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))    ;   XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);   /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/   However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co    urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button.

This was true (and I may add the adjective \\\"stupid\\\") until the Intifada. Since then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks the the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became the question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the  Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada and try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation). Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justified as it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that  prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:     I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \\\"schism\\\"; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are \\\"obedient\\\" or \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them \\\"disobedient\\\".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:      ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article \\\"Schism\\\")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine \\\"Si Si No No\\\".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The \\\"Si Si No No\\\" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:      The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio \\\"Ecclesia Dei\\\", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey \\\"justified disobedience\\\" or even \\\"obeying God rather than man\\\". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.\",\" It's the \\\"opening-game effect\\\" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for  rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things  hard to get it going against these \\\"worse\\\" nations.  I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better  it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.   Some other reasons why the \\\"worse\\\" teams are so tough to beat was presented  by Hans \\\"Virus\\\" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).   1) The \\\"worse\\\" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)     have now usually world class goalies.   2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much     less unnecessary penalties.   3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them \\\"run out of gas.\\\"   4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want.

For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and Greek Orthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a good old library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almost unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say.   If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.\",\" Gee!  Maybe I've misjudged you, Russell.  Anyone who agrees with something  I say can't be all bad.  ;-)  Seriously, I'm not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.   I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science  is mainly about avoiding mistakes.  And I still disagree with your  contention that nobody who doesn't use methods deemed \\\"scientific\\\"  can possibly know what's true and what's not.     Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees  of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \\\"If this hasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can't be of any interest to us.\\\"    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \\\"There've got to be controlled studies\\\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying \\\"We don't have any way of  knowing that it's effective.\\\"    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  \\\"Why should I prove your  theory?\\\"  and  \\\"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\\\"   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't  been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of  books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as I'm capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \\\"doctrinnaire\\\"  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \",\" [...stuff deleted...]  Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were  each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them, though your usage is quite valid.   I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or  describes things we can observe.  Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_, basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a  clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.  I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not  the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered  fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle  systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original  point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only  the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being  any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.  The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:     1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational         evidence (your way)     2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it         a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence   and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can         be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't  much to say.  Do you agree? \",\" /(hudson) /If someone inflicts pain on themselves, whether they enjoy it or not, they /are hurting themselves.  They may be permanently damaging their body.  That is true.  It is also none of your business.    Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian you are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off to \\\"re-education camps\\\" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for that?        /(hudson) /And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you /the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?  Why?  Because:  I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself. I do not \\\"need\\\" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the rules for me.  Because: I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do  the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.  Because: Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for  everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like  yours, the \\\"I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you\\\" bullshit  that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing, and other atrocities by other people who, like you, \\\"knew\\\" they were morally right.      (me)  /(hudson) /Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that?   It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not.  It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have  the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,  then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of  interference in your life.   (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference. However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).      (hudson) /Who gave /you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I  /cannot set a moral standard for others?   You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.    At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do; and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually interfere in my life.\",\"      Sure.

If that CS ignited at all, it would have been quite similar to a grain bin explosion.  Explosion, I note.  The entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.

Seems impossible, but thats how I  remember it. I also felt at the time that Johnny Callison of  the Phillies lost the MVP as a by-product of their swoon.        jerry\",\"  Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)   Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events. Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)   Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one (though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.   Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?   Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.   In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?   \\\"Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!\\\"  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?   I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?   Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as \\\"Americans\\\" first and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke \\\"low Dane,\\\" whereas others spoke \\\"high Dane.\\\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \\\"low Dane\\\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem, because we have even more obvious means of identifying an \\\"outsider.\\\"   Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.

The point has been raised and has been answered.  Roger and I have clearly stated our support of the BSA position on the issue; specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of the Scout Oath (specifically, the promise to live \\\"morally straight\\\").  There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't control their race but they can control their behavior).  What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue? Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious and moral standards on which our society has been established and on which it should continue to be based.\",\"Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,        even grief, over the deaths in Waco.

Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)        come to mind.

In     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three     categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special 'servers'.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve  julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README     for further details.      Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights.

This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the problem-- thus the French election and Italian pulizia.   Regarding the post-pulizia Italy:  Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord. The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy. Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.  (The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)  Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

This \\\"FAQ\\\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.    Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.    This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.      [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook     \\\"System Performance Tuning\\\" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the     way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written     comprehensive treatment of system performance.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:  \\\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\\\".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon \\\"twm\\\" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like \\\"zooming\\\" and \\\"opaque move\\\".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:   -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                         Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get \\\"*very* large speedups in the server\\\" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help   performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.        [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),           Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),           Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized here:      When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources     being fetched, programs initializing state and \\\"databases\\\" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (\\\"The process has reached a steady state\\\"),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstation's limited resources    This is most definitely a \\\"Your Mileage May Vary\\\" situation, as there   are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap   space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    I've experimented with:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 3; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    I've even tried:  (sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I had:  (sleep 1; exec xclock ) &  (sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  (sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a \\\"steady state\\\" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.          [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),            Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]    eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13   in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since   I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One suggestion:      In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true      Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your     .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:   setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The \\\"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\\\" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to     find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).       [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),            Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),                and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).       Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following   benefits:      - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has drawbacks:      - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       application's resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to \\\"xrdb\\\" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my   .Xdefaults file, and to use the \\\"separate resources files\\\" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    \\\"<hostname>:0.0\\\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to \\\"unix:0.0\\\" or \\\":0.0\\\".  By doing this   you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.    [thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]    See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further   explanation of how to properly set your display name.    \\\"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have   libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when   the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\\\"          Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.

Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there   a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]    I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try   and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

I suspect that   xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.   Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.    If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.

You don't have to    rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current    version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that    there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any    yet.     UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap    bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.    If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field Widgets:      I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm     conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.          [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)     for reminding me of this one. --ed.]  A Quicker Mouse - - - - - - - -   Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen   when you move your mouse.  I use \\\"xset m 3 10\\\" in my .xinitrc file,   which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of   the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.    Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for   fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different   mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.      e.g. (for twm) :       menu \\\"mouse settings\\\" {         \\\"Mouse Settings:\\\"   f.title  \\\"  Very Fast\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 7 10 &\\\"  \\\"  Normal (Fast)\\\"   ! \\\"xset m 3 10 &\\\"  \\\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\\\" ! \\\"xset m default &\\\"  \\\"  Glacial\\\"    ! \\\"xset m 0 10 &\\\"       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick out:      - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.      - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc     function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through it's event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This \\\"Gfx Context Switching\\\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).  Say What!? - - - - - -    Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:    David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :     How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs     on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your     machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the     same operation between client and server.    I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received   the following confirmation...    Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):     I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big     difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage     and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This     helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was     essential when I only had 8 MB.    Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :     [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as     your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.    Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):     A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \\\"Improving X     Application Performance\\\" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in     Issue 3 of The X Resource.      An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992     conference proceedings.

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior.  I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost   about $45.

The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.    Wow!

BACKGROUND  ----------   The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions   devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad   interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism,   roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,  motosports enthusiasts.   The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little  over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from  New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada  Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.   The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need   to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of   performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise   ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.   Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to   issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \\\"flame-free\\\".     HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------------   You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:           race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day  (depending on the topic).      NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the        list directly.    After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive  an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner  so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in  order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.    Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily  or digest distribution (as per your initial request).   HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION  ----------------------------------   It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a  single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out   whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the  frequency of postings this appears to be about every other  day.   Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every   30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:           digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    HOW TO POST TO THE LIST  -----------------------   This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:           race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM    Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may  not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it  (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)  you can include a \\\"metoo\\\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX  based mail systems).    BOUNCES  -------   Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace  the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with  bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,  sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of  employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive  bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and  if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I  administer this list) contact me through my administration  hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\\            XXXXX|                            |      \\\\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\\\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\\\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \\\"tuning\\\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.

Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.\",\"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace \\\"prince\\\" with \\\"government\\\" or \\\"president\\\", as appropriate, and read it again.    [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by Daniel Donno.]   In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow.   To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages.     When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is full of examples proving that this is so.   But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain.   ...\",\" I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  That is because your premises are wrong from the word \\\"Go\\\".  You claim that Christianity is based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the current thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.  Furthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs \\\"regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary.\\\"  Without any evidence to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem  argument.  Mind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion. It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do  base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to  the contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.  \",\"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.  First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first.  Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent.  Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!  Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of.  With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The larger the dog, the greater your anger.  Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.  Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped punishment.\",\"I responded to a post last week and it carried somewhat of a hostile tone for which I am apologizing for.

The weight I used for squats wasn't that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John   3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that   through him it might be saved.\\\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them\",\" I don't think such tools exist either.

Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each religion.   We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid (and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer services)).  God's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere, God may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not say for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where he has not/.  The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.   Only God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if that happens, it was the will of God.  Please send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what you said.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  \\\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\\\"  Stauber wondered.  \\\"Not that I'd be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.\\\"  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings' \\\"goalie of the future,\\\" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  \\\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\\\" Melrose said.  \\\"An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\\\"  \\\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.\\\"  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  \\\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\\\" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  \\\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\\\"  \\\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry  doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm a perfectionist.\\\"  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \\\"But  even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's  a bit of a jump,\\\" he said.  \\\"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I  do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\\\"  Melrose's \\\"goalie of the future\\\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \\\"Before you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\\\" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

Since they aren't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball, not the center cylindrical area.  I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might help.  I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl  alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.  If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin.   If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-( It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.  Hope this helps,  Murray   \",\" I remember a commercial for some cheap, top- heavy import cage a while back, where the  driver says while wearing a stuck-up fake  TV anouncers smile:  \\\"It Really goes Straight!\\\"\",\"dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually, reading between the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one respect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.  There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to admissible evidence.  This might put a stop to such things, which must from time to time be simple fishing expeditions.  David\",\" May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the \\\"Bible\\\" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement!    As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above, just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share my views.   What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same \\\"situation\\\" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for you... get into the \\\"soc.culture.arabic\\\" newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" (and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran). You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think the 1948-1967 \\\"situation\\\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you think?   All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \\\"Jews in the Qu'ran\\\" and think again.  \\\"Freedom of choice\\\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic state).   Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren that the _Covenant_ is \\\"null and void\\\" without getting assassinated himself!

I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that I was not \\\"brain-washed\\\".\",\" So what does that have to do with RBI's?  The team with the most RBI's doesn't necessarily win the game.  Yes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does every newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)

You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.   Then as you understand it, what is it?   Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus? Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.    Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.     Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \\\"stop doubting and believe\\\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \\\"The world hates him without reason.\\\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.\",\" Right on, it is every citizen's right and duty to FORCE government accountability.

For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to 'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.

What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended' under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles where you wouldn't survive an accident.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the  low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and  would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's  another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is  depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern  electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.  this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about  to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as  little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight. \",\"  I wish I hadn't sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars.

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source.    When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one the requires a kind of \\\"faith\\\" too.   By taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.

In the camps, he added,  terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's  and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from  the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the  extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so  that they can travel from one region to another without being  confronted by legal obstacles.

According to  sources close        to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian        militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos        mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated        that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military        training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.        They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for        Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing        their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the        clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist        groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations        moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they        would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a        number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos        mountains.         Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,        which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in        Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs        of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material        support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader        of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,        George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men        not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out        by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \\\"extreme        racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\\\"  Reliable        sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent        operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that        organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in        extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he        instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the        PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established        that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his        camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking        were exposed.

I was told this somewhere or other, but it's not mentioned in \\\"Apple Facts\\\" (guide for apple sellers), in the press release or in the technical specs.\",\" DAMN RIGHT it doesn't!  Ohm's come from the greek letter omega, which is used for resistance/impedance.  Of course, the original poster MAY have been being facetious (let's hope so).\",\"     It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have 400 000 arab citizens.   And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It is not a hostile action leading to war.    Oh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who they vote for as the Jews.    Huh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no reason for Israel to let them in.    Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how is granting citizenship a facade?     Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to establish what it is.   Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel. There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500. Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that make the land Jewish?

Once the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC.  Unfortunately there is still a \\\"ghost\\\" of SPSS left: when I run something like \\\"Write\\\" and go to embed an object then \\\"SPSS Chart\\\" appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all the obvious \\\"INI\\\" files without success. The next thing I tried was looking for the string \\\"SPSS Chart\\\" in every file in the  Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel inclined to edit it.  I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.\",\"An review of both the Mac and Windows versions in either PC Week or Info World this week, said that the Windows version was considerably slower than the Mac.

They are better in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.   It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway, without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.

(now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con - for the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to say below on this).   Sorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a conclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence  of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something  (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they  disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never  seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \\\"pink unicorn\\\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the  appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that  \\\"pink unicorns\\\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A \\\"pink unicorn\\\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \\\"more primitive\\\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share  a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical frame work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM.      I disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as existence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant we can come back to it.    You are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \\\"evidence\\\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).  BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not EVEN wrong.    I don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of things that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one cannot use observation to infer that \\\"God does not exist\\\". Such a positive assertion requires a leap.       Once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no EVIDENCE that \\\"'god is' is meaningful\\\" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a \\\"theist\\\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.     \",\"     Digitally-tuned shorwave radio with alarm clock and 5 presets per band.

One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

So, operating on purely /selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a /team player in the leg.  He gets to play in front of the talent scout.  /Did that freshman behave morally?  /Selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but /not always.    Two problems right off the bat:  1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn't address the goal that I started with:  winning the game.

Perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the minority.   Where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?

Once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.  And, you still have not answered my question.

For those interested in joining, please send e-mail to that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.  The blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original  announcement for where Motif++ can be obtained.  Enjoy!  8< - 8< -   Welcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!  The Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++ wrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++,  swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the  bindings.   All requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc. should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl  All e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to messages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded  from auto-replies.  Enjoy!  Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference  (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group, Utrecht |    The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.  8< - 8< -  Hello Motif World,  over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:  HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release offers:  - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake        and its config files on your site. I have tried to        provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable        for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely        tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you        have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma        release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude        of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS  Ftp:  Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.  Note:  Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings.  E-mail:  Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

Craig\",\" Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.  (Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)   I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.   Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science: Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.   I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.   It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\",\" Very easily.

For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).    This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.  The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit.  BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).  Thanks in advance,  Wayne Schellekens <schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>\",\"#  Actually, I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject # (i.e. the \\\"new, inproved\\\" survey saying that roughly 1% of men are gay) # on the front page of The New York _Times_ recently (I think it was # on Thurs, 15 April).  The headline was something to the effect of  # \\\"New Survey Finds 1% of Men Are Gay\\\" #  #  I was shocked, not because the New York _Times_ was running a story # on a sex survey (although that was part of it), but because they thought # that this news was actually important enough to warrant front page space. # I mean, how many people actually CARE how many people are gay (as long as # you know how to find/avoid them if you want to)?  I don't.    If you don't care, why was so much effort put into promoting the 10% lie?  Because it was important to scare politicians into obedience.  #        -Matt\",\"About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver (I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver.  So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their FAX number?  Any assistance appreciated.  Regards  BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with      the rest with the 641.\",\"I write:     and a (You've hardware The the set same programs programs forget having   After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I came up with: ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm. Quick summary of each commmand: Z0 - Reset modem to User Profile 0. L2 - Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet) N2 - Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet) X5 - Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual) &D0 - Assume DTR (computer) is always on S11=50 - Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)  In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer  function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra 14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.  In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and everything seems to work fine.  Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something to add, feel free.

BACKGROUND:   I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and  2. a Sun SS10 without any X.     I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP Access Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!     I've tried to get \\\"xhost\\\" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong or the X11R3 implementation is bogus.     I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the  NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.   My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!\",\"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.\",\"In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.     Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter?  One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of  his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric.   This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \\\"race\\\" of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome, the gas chambers of Auschwitz.  The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating. Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be  emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to  govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the latter as a \\\"strong\\\" government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness.  It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates of a system that would commit genocide.   The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.  No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon  election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit. If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A  rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice. In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.  It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a  task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns, even of personal security.  Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to  control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot  affect the system. \",\" One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now, you may not be able to later.

Numerous articles in major newspapers  (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested  the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the  Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to  deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his  deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt  obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history. Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control'  or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger  Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration  as deplorable but insignificant.[1]  [1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'     E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.    Source: \\\"Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6\\\"   Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately   forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi   collaboration.   A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The   magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany  and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the  magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,  is attention-getting.   This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically  important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.    In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They   occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.  The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered   \\\"Aryan\\\" and what befell them.  Now wait, there is more.  Source: \\\"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\\\" by Avetis Aharonian.

The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using + for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern, for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit.  --       Robert I.

Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \\\"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\\\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \\\"theoretically\\\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \\\"Fast by Ferraci\\\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design     team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's     satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn's rings.

JPL has developed a backup plan using data     compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft     that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

The two-day program, cosponsored by the library and Baltimore Hebrew University, with additional support from the Project Judaica Foundation, will be held in the library's Mumford Room, sixth floor, Madison Building.    Seating is limited, and admission to any session of the symposium must be requested in writing (see Note A).    The symposium will be held one week before the public opening of a major exhibition, \\\"Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship,\\\" that opens at the Library of Congress on April 29.  On view will be fragmentary scrolls and archaeological artifacts excavated at Qumran, on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  Approximately 50 items from Library of Congress special collections will augment these materials.  The exhibition, on view in the Madison Gallery, through Aug. 1, is made possible by a generous gift from the Project Judaica Foundation of Washington, D.C.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have been the focus of public and scholarly interest since 1947, when they were discovered in the desert 13 miles east of Jerusalem.  The symposium will explore the origin and meaning of the scrolls and current scholarship.  Scholars from diverse academic backgrounds and religious affiliations, will offer their disparate views, ensuring a lively discussion.    The symposium schedule includes opening remarks on April 21, at 2 p.m., by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, and by Dr. Norma Furst, president, Baltimore Hebrew University.  Co-chairing the symposium are Joseph Baumgarten, professor of Rabbinic Literature and Institutions, Baltimore Hebrew University and Michael Grunberger, head, Hebraic Section, Library of Congress.    Geza Vermes, professor emeritus of Jewish studies, Oxford University, will give the keynote address on the current state of scroll research, focusing on where we stand today. On the second day, the closing address will be given by Shmaryahu Talmon, who will propose a research agenda, picking up the theme of how the Qumran studies might proceed.    On Wednesday, April 21, other speakers will include:     -- Eugene Ulrich, professor of Hebrew Scriptures, University of Notre Dame and chief editor, Biblical Scrolls from Qumran, on \\\"The Bible at Qumran;\\\"    -- Michael Stone, National Endowment for the Humanities distinguished visiting professor of religious studies, University of Richmond, on \\\"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Pseudepigrapha.\\\"    -- From 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. a special preview of the exhibition will be given to symposium participants and guests.     On Thursday, April 22, beginning at 9 a.m., speakers will include:     -- Magen Broshi, curator, shrine of the Book, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, on \\\"Qumran: The Archaeological Evidence;\\\"    -- P. Kyle McCarter, Albright professor of Biblical and ancient near Eastern studies, The Johns Hopkins University, on \\\"The Copper Scroll;\\\"    -- Lawrence H.

A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.    If you think so you sure don't pay attention to my postings.\",\"  Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of his supporters.   See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself. Its birth was by secret executive order by Harry S Truman in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?  On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit television.  More paranoia.  These are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?  Do you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese had been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?  Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about their Engima with respect to Turing and the British.  How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little more paranoia have helped the Germans here?  Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...  Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?  The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system. Soviet paranoia, right?  And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And  huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.  When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time even with a \\\"secret\\\" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very* thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?  I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as it can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...  And we know the government is violent -- even against children as recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence that our government institutions have in their contempt for our civil rights.  And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of caution because that does much less harm than erring on the reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.  I might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.  \",\"I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory advice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an opinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is extremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't know.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code only tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a wide variety of ways.  And the public at large?

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.

The hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian, not a Muslim.   Regarding Bernard Lewis:  Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.  Read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.  In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).   I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.   If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some Muslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too.   I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_.  Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title \\\"Islam and Women\\\", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.    IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \\\"I am a Muslim\\\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?   You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of  capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)   One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.   Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.   The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \\\"following the Qur'an\\\" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.    You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.   I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.   Here too.   Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.\",\"I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic   person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.   When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played   up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks   the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.  I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe   the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear   things like \\\"They just don't value human life like we do...\\\" and so on.

British promised to Venizelos (greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman). The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few, forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the \\\"Allies\\\" gave any green light because they liked us....)  Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end. After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises (as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual \\\"reasoning\\\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually backup Kemal (who had given now to the British \\\"water and bread\\\" that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities. The \\\"greek empire\\\" being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client.  Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \\\"Giants\\\" by the British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region. Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because otherwise the use of terror of changing \\\"the balance of power in the Aegean\\\" will be used.

I'd like the 3D software to run on primarily Mac in either C, Object Pascal (Think or MPW). But, I'll port to Windows later, so a package that runs on Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal.  I'm looking for a package that has low upfront costs, and reasonable licensing costs... of course :)\",\" No. When the program is run, it loads 4 configuration files; autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini, and system.ini. There is no Open entry on the File menu. You can only edit these four files. If you need to edit some other program's .ini file, use Notepad or some other ASCII editor.  I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice multi-file replacement for Notepad.\",\"I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some have been positive but most are negative. Could people please confirm these?

I haven't seen it, or any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups which I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it, check it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these sorts of things.  I have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this article, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in light of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand it is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register a car) and other proposals regarding 'smart' national Identity Cards, wiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in the wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps suggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from acquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs any possible benefits, IMO.  BTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been promoting, in an even more disturbing form.  That said, with no further comment, the article follows:  ------------ Begin included article ---------  Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.      ---------------------------------------------------                           THE WHITE HOUSE                    Office of the Press Secretary  _________________________________________________________________  For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY   The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.  For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.  Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.  A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" has been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.  This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.   A \\\"key-escrow\\\" system will be established to ensure that the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                   2   \\\"keys,\\\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \\\"key-escrow\\\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap.  The \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings.  The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists.  We need the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:       --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;       --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone           calls and data, under proper court or other legal           order, when necessary to protect our citizens;       --   the effective and timely use of the most modern           technology to build the National Information           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and           the competitiveness of American industry in the global           marketplace; and        --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export           high technology products.  The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                    3  The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\\\"information superhighways\\\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone system transmits voice.  Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law.  Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" technology provides law enforcement with      no new authorities to access the content of the private      conversations of Americans.  Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to      decipher the message?  A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They      would then present documentation of this authorization to      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key      escrow system.  Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?  A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will      oversee the key-escrow data banks.  Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure      how strong the security is?    A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all      potential users that there are no unrecognized      vulnerabilities.  Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?  A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet      officials.  Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?  A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the      decisions related to this initiative.  Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?  A:   The government designed and developed the key access      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip      manufacturer that produces them.  Q:   Who provides the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\"?  A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed      to other vendors in the future.  Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating      the \\\"Clipper Chip\\\" into their devices.       Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more      powerful encryption devices?  A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive      than others readily available today, but it is just one      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to      encryption technology, which the Administration is      developing.       The Administration is not saying, \\\"since encryption      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,      we will prohibit it outright\\\" (as some countries have      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \\\"every      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an      unbreakable commercial encryption product.\\\"  There is a      false \\\"tension\\\" created in the assessment that this issue is      an \\\"either-or\\\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,      balanced approach such as is proposed with the \\\"Clipper      Chip\\\" and similar encryption techniques.  Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from      that of the Bush Administration?    A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption      technology in telecommunications and computing and are      committed to working with industry and public-interest      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime      and terrorism.  Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use      the government hardware?  A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability      of these products.  ----------- End included article -----------  \",\"For sale:  NEC TurboGrafx-16 video game system.

I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.

Or can any other cards do this (like the Micron Xceed) ?  Also which monitor should I buy?

And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)   *  In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what I meant by \\\"There is no way out of the loop\\\".  I wrote that human brains \\\"are infested with sin\\\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.    Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:   The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:   But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.\",\"I bought an Intrepid about two months ago and am very happy with it.

I was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked me for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some \\\"spiritual gifts,\\\" as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.

The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.

Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.

The Vice President will take part in the \\\"Kids World  Council: Plan It for the Planet\\\" from 2-5 PM (EDT) Saturday  (4/17) in Orlando, Florida.  He will tour a display of student  environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting  where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about  the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound  future.       The town hall meeting will be moderated by Linda Ellerbee  and taped for a news special, \\\"Nickelodeon Special Edition:  Plan  It for the Planet,\\\" which will air on Sunday, April 18 at 8 PM  (EDT).  It is sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Children's Earth  Fund.       \\\"Young people care about the environment because they know  it affects our future.  Across the country and around the world,  young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges  we face.  They are identifying problems, thinking about  solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders,\\\" the  Vice President said.       The Kids World Council delegates are meeting for three days  in Orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable  energy.  They will be following the format and goals of the Earth  Summit that took place last year in Rio de Janeiro.  The Vice  President led the Senate Delegation to the Earth Summit.       \\\"I look forward to hearing what young people have to say  about the environment and their future.  Their insight into the  world around us is important,\\\" the Vice President said.

But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from NSA.)    If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered to that serial number, either:    1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy? All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.    2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series. (This part is really scary.  Since the \\\"expectation\\\" is that all chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give access to all.)    3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target keys.)      Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones. Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide much better security.    --       Robert I. Eachus\",\"The Bmw speedo is triggered by a reed switch\\\\magnet assembly in the differential. I would think that this signal would be easy to reproduce. \",\"I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few  questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred  times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).  How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to  'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to DC.\",\" This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician, I almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous is going around, I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case. When I do get really sick, it is always something unusual.  This was not the situation when I was in medical school, particularly on pediatrics. I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!  I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us, so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that around.\",\"[insert deletion of Paul's and Aaron's discourse on anger, ref Galatians 5:19-20]  Oh, but they definitely can be.

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.    Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses    (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.     Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions.

Request information from above address.    phantom@mead.u.washington.edu    -----------------------------     Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site     address for information.    Notes   =====      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often     running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues     are wholly unresolved.      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP     software (see the question on cryptography).     - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)     vary between sites.    - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.  _____ <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?       Users   -----    - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases     network traffic.   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'     hierarchy is preferred.   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even     future ones under the same handle.   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by     sending anonymized mail to yourself.   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.      Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating     his hardware, all for your convenience.    Operators   ---------    - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or     lassaiz-faire?   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your     users trust you to protect them.   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is     your commitment to it?   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.      Consult a lawyer about your liability.   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If     possible, query group readers.   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.    Readers   -------      - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its     volume is heavy or increasing).   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,     harassment, extortion, etc.   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they     offend you personally.   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the     idea of anonymity itself.   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or     `conceivable' need exists.

Not perfect and won't   > kill followups.       Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.    _____ <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?    Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through   servers like there's no tomorrow.''      Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste   <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''    K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus   against it.     K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was   created.''    In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.      J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of   anonymity is also controversial.    For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating   through many newsgroups.       The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his   detractors.    Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.    Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.      Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,   etc.    A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the   software to the public domain.    Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and   encryption.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and  no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has  already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens  of read-only cells already in the colormap.

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such, is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.  Bill  : If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering : the meaning of the word \\\"objective\\\" I doubt that this will ever happen.  : So, back to the original question:  : And objective morality is.....?  This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory. Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The concept supposedly described may have meaning however.  If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed, He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense. If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective. If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous, meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined. Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm, or the preferred conduct of \\\"decent\\\" people, making it seem subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard. Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as\",\"In <1993Apr15.143320.8618@desire.wright.edu>, demon@desire.wright.edu sez:  There's this minor thing called \\\"interest of finality/repose\\\".  What it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again because the losing side \\\"discovers\\\" some \\\"new\\\" evidence.  I don't know about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole in case the verdict goes against him.  BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new trial \\\"based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence\\\" if made within 2 years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.     Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time through.

The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about .025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.

At least it's better than fielding percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR, dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.  But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack. That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports this point of view.)

My machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in.      Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \\\"maps\\\" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \\\"cd\\\" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)        John  \",\"I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me. But here is how i understand it.  At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe. It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.     Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are subtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.\",\" when does carrying a tool classify someone as a rambo.  so all the pioneers that came west were rambo's?  adrienne!!!  :-)   would your tune change if you were one of the \\\"dozen or two bear attacks\\\"? believe me, when you need a firearm, you NEED a firearm.   please cite your references.   i'll let others (please note followup) cite valid references to show you that this is an untruth.   well, you might as well go naked.  forget the matches, backpack, sleeping bag and all the rest that's is a modern convenience.  a firearm is just a tool.  as some people won't carry gaiters, some people do.  firearms should be in the same category.  it should be a personal choice.  and your factoid about shooting victims in the ER.  count how many come in due to automobile accidents and automobile crimes.  maybe we should outlaw cars. \",\"  Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is.

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building.

Official history says that  the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi  party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of  the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using  homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual?).   Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references  to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the  night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even  the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case,  this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the  1920's.   Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with  homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know  what tainted \\\"evidence\\\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made  by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those  accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the  1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in  time and plant \\\"tainted\\\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers  which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being  obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in  these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a  false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point  here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof  falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework  before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.   This is just about the *only* thing we agree on.   I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and  his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If  you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them  and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from  their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.   Given that you already consider all evidence \\\"tainted\\\", what on earth would constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been considered \\\"shrewd guesses\\\"?  I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) - historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious  footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually  provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place  to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.  I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

DS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was DS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front DS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?  No. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max Friz's famous design, but with an overhead \\\"point cam\\\" (see below for more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so that the ground clearance was substantially increased:         ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                  Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/  This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke.  The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves.  Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the \\\"waterwheel\\\" which kept the lobe spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).  Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This was feasible because it was a racing engine.  With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point:                      /\\\\                    /()\\\\   <-lobe                   / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to  valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)                 |  |   | |                 |  |===| |                     =0=  <---piston                      |                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                              curvature because there was none in the                              head itself. The bore curve would start                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in                              this diagram   The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the name.  The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate (approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two Springers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern record of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle historians discount this story.

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation.

One readily   reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate...\\\"   He also stated that:  \\\"they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian   invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and  fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least  a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.\\\"                   TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST  An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution, 1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.  Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews?  Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish. I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews, I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the 500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research, mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis.  - How exactly did they do this?  The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in 1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist, came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey. One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew.  - How so?  Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other officials and say in effect:  \\\"These people are Turkish citizens. You  can't do  this  to  them.\\\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.  The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey. They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews. The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish consuls took place.  The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \\\"irregular fellow citizen.\\\" The  document said in  effect \\\"This person is  a former Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\\\"  The diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.  Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything.  - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?  There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the information in this section of  the book relates to the situation in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well. Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country.  - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin from Nazi persecution.  Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey. On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally. Turkey  protested,   saying,  \\\"You  are  dividing   our  citizens according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion. Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\\\" American consuls in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to 1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul.  Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government, yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700 Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to send money and food out of the country.  - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be living in Israel.  Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.  - And you have rescued it from obscurity.  Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.  When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.  About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  - translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they could see the documents.  - What languages are used in the documents?  Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The documents related to his mission are in English.  I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone someday will make the effort.  - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?  Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992.  - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken place, what do you plan to do next?  I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements.  Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional service activities and public lectures  in both the United States and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2 vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983, 1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most of our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]  Christ warns that anyone who \\\"breaks one of the least of these commandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven\\\" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I must respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology.   1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \\\"where no law is, there is no transgression.\\\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \\\"what ever He says to do we will do.\\\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \\\"better promises\\\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \\\"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\\\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \\\"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\\\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \\\"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.   People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \\\"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\\\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \\\"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\\\"  \\\"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\\\" (Rom. 7:12).   Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \\\"lay by him in store\\\" with \\\"go to a worship service.\\\"  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \\\"esteem all days alike\\\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \\\"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\\\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \\\"on the first day of every week\\\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.\",\"  On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that Koresh trained the women (years ago) how to commit suicide by swallowing cyanide or by putting a gun in their mouth.  With cyanide on hand, why choose to roast yourself?  There are too many unanswered questions here. -- \",\"  Never. I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an  index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned  and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude  of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.  Now I would like to ask you:    Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to    this one?  And again I would like to ask you:    Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands   of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a \\\"Final   Solution\\\" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not   to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to   Jewish problems?

The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.   My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.   People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.   This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?   I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.\",\" 53 seconds to hash 20M of core (I bet I know who the source of your information is!).

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line that installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility. It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the version of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however, install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:    1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.        i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?    2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?

I quote:    \\\"... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in   select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the   Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the   the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people   to keep and bear Arms ....\\\"  - Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).  Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that the amendment protected the individual right to possess military weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the interpretation.  Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:   \\\"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,   and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the   United States, as well as its interpretation by every major   commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-   cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right   of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\\\"    - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the      Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,      97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )  You might rightfully ask \\\"well then, what does that first bit about militias mean?\\\"  Well, \\\"militia\\\" in historical context basically means the whole of the adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines \\\"militia\\\" as all armed men over the age of 17).     \\\"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting     in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were     expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of     the kind in common use at the time.\\\"  - Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).  The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than the other way around.     \\\"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).  A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.  Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one.  Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).

Both the \\\"External Tank\\\" and \\\"Wingless Orbiter\\\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the \\\"giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,\\\" and building a \\\"station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\\\"  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option \\\"A\\\" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses \\\"Bus-1\\\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's      qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A \\\"Power Station Capability\\\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an \\\"arrow mode\\\" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option \\\"B\\\" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option \\\"B\\\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \\\"A\\\"). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options \\\"A\\\" and \\\"B\\\".  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A \\\"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\\\" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.\",\" You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in place of the bolt.

Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.  As an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one- dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation between the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness from reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model  in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to our boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer. He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry, the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would probably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.  To quote from H.S. Yoder,   The postulated models have become accepted as the reality  instead of the lattice of assumptions they are.  Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical  analysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism  of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because  many key parameters have not been included.  This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought I'd clear that up before things really got out of hand.    --  boundary\",\"This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by Le Magnifique and The Great One.

The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining 5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing. The error message reported was like:  Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.  This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors, but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however, I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:     o Frequent crashes    o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to        correct.    o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.        - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the          disk either.        - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes          requires several attempts.

Is there some       diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?    3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest       and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the       end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx       terminator.

Anyway..  1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????    As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls    0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on    entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given     conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to    screen memory in terms of portability?\",\"   I had this one time.

By:    Ken Evans, Imagicians Artware, Inc.   When:  Tuesday 20 April 1993 7:00pm-9:00pm   Where: The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology        University of Toronto        39A Queen's Park Crescent        Toronto  Who:   Members and non-members alike         (non-members encouraged to become members...)  Abstract:  Imagicians Artware, Inc. is entering into early beta site testing on Silicon  Graphics workstations of a new 2D abstract artwork and animation package called  Chance's Art.  The package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the  technical issues will be discussed.  Marketing plans will be outlined.  The  talk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly  confronting small startup software companies today, and some of the  opportunities this situation presents.  Time after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to  interested parties.  Silicon Graphics is graciously providing an Indigo for  this event.  Myck Kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive  reflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the McLuhan Centre, so  feel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. BTW, be  sure to sing \\\"Happy Birthday, Myck\\\"...  The names of nominees for our Siggraph executive offices will be announced at  this meeting.  Nominations will still be open until the election at our  May 18th event; call Myck Kupka at 465-0943 or fax to 465-0729.

Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).  \",\"The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality.

Cute.        Let's talk practicality, shall we?  If the Monarch tried to do something, what would happen?            But you illustrated the problem very well.          I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)          So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some of the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only*  responsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)          Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe. In any case, we're talking about *education*.            Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the situation.         At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.          I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a \\\"tax heaven\\\" and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration. The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2) the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an \\\"Education crisis\\\" in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat) while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children than ugly art.         It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the consent of the governed.           They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)         Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders. So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency with fairly broad powers, including the veto.         Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this. Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.         So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.          No, if the \\\"progressives\\\" don't want the \\\"reactionaries\\\" to move backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent' very effective, especially since it is usually geographically concentrated.        When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't have to make a better argument than, \\\"more people than not,\\\" agree.                 I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)                And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.                Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer \\\"It isn't democratic,\\\" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should* it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few people advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of democracy to bias it against action so much worse? \",\" Oh, *really*???   I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub.  While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \\\"libertarian\\\" faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as   Please explain this one, hopefully in a way that Canadian readers besides myself can understand and concur ...  gld\",\": HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related : subjects.

For example, if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.  When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's because they're implemented by a single card.\",\"I have become involved in a project to further develop and  improve the performance of SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) imaging.

Thanks in advance for any replies\",\"From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):  This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to do with this.  Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of course, I could say \\\"Buy all you want, we'll support more.\\\" -- \",\"     ....................   This example is probably wrong.  There is the case of one famous physicist telling another that he was probably wrong.  As I recall the quote:   Your ideas are crazy, to be sure.  But they are not crazy  enough to be right.  The typical screwball is only somewhat screwy.\",\"From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving  a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure. \",\" Can't we move the political bickering to a more appropriate group? --  Brad Kepley                  Internet         kepley@photon.phys.unca.edu Work-days                    Voice            (704)252-8330\",\"The following is a survey we are conducting for a term project in a philosophy class.

About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.  Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra. On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993) ............................................................................  THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on  cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International  Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE  Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer  Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and  Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program  for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of  the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees  at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.  In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the  program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for  informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to  demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest.  If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General  Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include  hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a  beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included  in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.  ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of  the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent  to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are  available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference  participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the  dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate  arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is  enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants.  However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire  a parking permit.  TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the  Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including  American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service  will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday  and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented  in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the  north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles  north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.  REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance  at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late  registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space  is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached  registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in  full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first  come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The  conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions,  as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of  Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals  are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends  should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.  ............................................................................

If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly.     To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or  /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is set up.     Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX.

They just become very sad and try to figure out what they did wrong. -Dave Barry\",\"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /   I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \\\"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\\\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.\",\"        Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove.          I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.           It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.          This is very likely.          The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't. Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.          No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S., two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate.         The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody, whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent.        Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.        Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.           In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms. (50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per  se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got more knives or fists.           In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is  violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The *vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of 99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.          The situation is not \\\"good\\\" in that people fear for their lives. But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots, protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they, too, lost their livelihoods?          The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't. However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.         You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough, as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)          45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun. That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans. Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.         You may take that for what it's worth. \",\"Has anyone written or seen a C library or C++ class for fixed-point math, or good articles about same?

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon. \",\"Does XFree86 support any EISA video cards under Dell 2.2?\",\"  I heard boot_b.zip could do exactly what you wanted without touching anything.

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions.  Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.\",\"  Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke \\\"Q\\\" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from Jesus' mouth.   The version of the \\\"usual theory\\\" I have heard has Matthew and Luke independently relying on Mark and \\\"Q\\\".  One would think that if Luke relied on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies, for one thing.   This is the part that is particularly new to me.  If it were possible that you could point me to a reference, I'd be grateful.    Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.     I'm not really impressed with the \\\"theology\\\" argument.  But I'm really pointing this out as an \\\"if\\\".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter.    The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is not so bad.   But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.\",\"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. \",\"That is correct.  in DOS you can use IRQ 7 for your SB.You can't do that under OS/2 because it uses IRQ 7 for the printer \",\"# #They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them, # #rent to them, and do business with them, regardless of the feelings # #or beliefs of the other person. #  # Cramer, you are off your target again.

They're very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).  I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.  From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison:         Wintach                Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro   9.33  10.34  20.78 8.28 14.90  13.58  my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster    9.88   8.65  11.71 18.84 15.40  13.65   Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.  Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets?

This is how the history  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been  a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see  why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened   between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that  the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two  countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.    I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.  Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.    I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.  I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece  in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this  means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many  Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?    Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.

Advice from a grad student.   I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me. The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and  learn as much as possible about it.     In my five years of education in this field, though brief  compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of  question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant.      I have come to believe that choosing CS because one  does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a  part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.   My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to  learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your  persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year.                     Hey you may be so interested in this field that you  decided to learn all about the making of computers in which  case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.   About the money.

Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person, but it's still no more than a guess. It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don't respond.  There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose.

One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.   Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware? In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware. I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.   However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its  designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion  of such techniques seems credible.  Hmmm...

This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand.

I will not use styrofoam table service. Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is    God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because    showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not    constitute what the Apostle Paul called \\\"becoming all things to all men so    that by all possible means I might save some.\\\"     Don't say \\\"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time    on.\\\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your    credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not    creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and    glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords    woven in the infinite tapestry.\",\"***** IBM GAMES FOR SALE OR TRADE *****  o ADVENTURE    Eric the Unready -- Legend -- $35   King's Quest V -- Sierra -- CD-ROM edition -- $35  o SPORTS    Michael Jordan In Flight -- Electronic Arts -- $35   Mike Ditka's Ultimate Football -- Accolade -- $30   David Ledbetter's Greens -- Microprose -- $30  o STRATEGY    Risk -- Virgin -- $10   This software comes with all original packaging and manuals.

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter's influence.   Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.

If you know of any interesting new stuff, I would be intrested in hearing about it.\",\"To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.     This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis \\\"A is not not-A\\\". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \\\"believe\\\", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. \\\"I believe Tom went to  the library.\\\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \\\"I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\\\" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)    Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)    It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.    Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.   Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error.\",\"  That's nonsense!!

In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand on two of her comments.   One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.  Past snippets from this thread:    Back to Lee Lady:   These posters are making the mistake that I have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" is neither always possible nor always important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kind of claim to ask for a \\\"carefully designed and controlled study\\\" to alleviate our skepticism.)  Rules such as \\\"support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study\\\" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation. I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (To reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic.)  \",\"Hmm.  $1 billion, lesse...

Open it up and look for the power amp \\\"ICs\\\".  They'll be fairly obvious.  Replace the one connected to the dead output.    Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing. \",\"Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.   New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak  To: National Desk, Environment Writer  Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both           of the Natural Resources Defense Council     WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.    The EPA list is attached.    \\\"These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration,\\\" said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC.  \\\"Water contamination isn't just a problem in Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.\\\"    \\\"As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution,\\\" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline.    Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia.    Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems.    \\\"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public,\\\" Olson noted.  \\\"The time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink.\\\"    NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory. +       The header line in 'read' menu includes \\\"(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)\\\". +         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written.

I keep  getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the  program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so  I can't seem to explain why it crashes.  All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??   I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.

Our people will continue to fuel the torch  of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the  occupied homeland is liberated...''  --- Yasser Arafat, AP, 3/12/79   So, Ahmed is right.

Adam   Adam Shostack            adam@das.harvard.edu\",\" For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?  Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?\",\" Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was interviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.  This is good, IMO.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the \\\"bimbo\\\" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \\\"we\\\" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the \\\"let me run this price by the sales manager\\\".  After playing the \\\"good salesman, bad salesman\\\" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \\\"Don't Get Taken Every Time\\\" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \\\"you'll have to work with us on this price\\\", also known as \\\"each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten\\\", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said \\\"well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you\\\" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from \\\"his\\\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, \\\"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\\\" So my friend bought a

One is a capable and smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great brakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but great on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but I don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going to pluck me by the short hairs.    Unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of  driving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left... accelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to discount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.  By the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes there, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two, per annum.\",\" Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2? Or an equivalent?  If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory, compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.  Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.  Cheers,\",\"  Koberg,   Just a couple of minor corrections here...   1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \\\"signifying believers\\\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \\\"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\\\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \\\"these signs following them that believe\\\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \\\"saved\\\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \\\"Neo-Pentecostals\\\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.\",\" Or perhaps any planning at all.  :-)  Hiya Pete, still got that CBX? Nice to hear from you again!   Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the  rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the  CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.\",\"OFM responds to a query about reference works:     [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an    introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary    styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further    reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The \\\"Introduction\\\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \\\"OK\\\" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).     ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...  So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title (James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think I recall a (older) series under the name \\\"Harper Commentaries\\\".  Also there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD.)  My favorite one-volume commentary is the \\\"New Jerome Biblical Commentary\\\".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent.  NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the \\\"Jerome Biblical Commentary\\\", copies of which can still be found on sale.\",\"Here's a copy of a letter I'm e-mailing to the Slickster at his address of 75300.3115@compuserve.com:  ____________________________________________________________________________  To: William J.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such \\\"storys\\\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech \\\"boiler\\\" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the \\\"CARNOT-process\\\" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \\\"cold\\\"          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem.

There are a staggering number of victims in the world and more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims, including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.   Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did not have an army or a government.   I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks, it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.  It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.   I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was not nearly as risky.   Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not \\\"everyone\\\" wants to help the side that is less like us.  I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is innocent.  There are just too many good reasons to stay away:  1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders    in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the    Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to    promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible    for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.  2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.

If most people }use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports }test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though }scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?  That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was \\\"enlightened for its times\\\". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is \\\"disgusting\\\", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history.\",\" Hi Adda,  Most Bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time -- the time when the author wrote it.  Unfortunately, like all works from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.    There are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the mid second century (A.D. 130+).  There are some complete books, letters, etc. from the middle third century.  The first complete collection of the New Testament dates from the early 4th century (A.D. 325).  Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings.   If you mean that someone discovered thousands of \\\"Bibles\\\" which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...No!  If you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime shortly after A.D. 50, then yes.

In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]  \\\"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it   becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary.

Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise    to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would    help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Afterwards, we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.

Questions to Israelis   To:  shaig@Think.COM  Subject: Ten questions to Israelis  Dear Shai,  Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.  In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have received from other quarters, according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship (Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all times and present them at many public places, almost every day. These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab. You maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ? Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose ?  In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).  Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.  Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?  You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so. I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\",\" They aren't functions, they are character arrays.

Being brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me.   Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat each other.\",\"  My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.

Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster move:  Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch.  Lines:  Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Summary:  Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \\\"outstanding\\\"). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.  Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.  Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.  The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.  But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4.  Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.  Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19. The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc notes:  Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that \\\"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\\\" has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has to be changed.  Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property.

In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (\\\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\\\").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical \\\"95-95\\\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.   True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By \\\"impure\\\", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John\",\"  This is ok in my opinion as long as the stuff *returns to earth*.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv) and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be cheap.    My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit.    At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor circuit.

Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.    Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.     These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.    People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that \\\"pisses off\\\" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.    See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   poisoning.   Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home, plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of things.  But it might be the MSG.    If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.   Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.\",\"I have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality and decided that I was interested in videotaped copies of these.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,  from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for  strong cryptography through a distinct organization.  The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one step removed from the old \\\"crypto-wielding child molester\\\" argument.  An EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the connection to child pornography and the like.  Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it stands to be labelled as \\\"communist\\\", \\\"anarchist hackers\\\", radical, etc.    I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political baggage.  Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going to do about it?

It's been done so much, that it  would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then  transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS). Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a  company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain  circuitry I can use?

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me know what you think.  DISCLAIMER ---------- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anything other than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ---------------------  1)  What is RIPEM?   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using  the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your  electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who  sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except  the intended recipient.)   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>.  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines,  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  2)  How can I get RIPEM?   RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution  to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or  Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README  file:   #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me,  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.   Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using  RIPEM.   The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will  reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the  humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the  friend.   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents  in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for  info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and  does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version.   RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \\\"home site\\\" on  rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out  how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are  available here in addition to the full source tree.  3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine?   Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports  are expected, and help of users is invited.  4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?   Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH.  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU  Emacs.   If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure,  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  5)  What is RSA?   RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means  that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other,  you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your  decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to  decrypt it.  (Note that the \\\"message\\\" sent with RSA is normally just  the DES key to the real message. (See \\\"What is DES?\\\")   Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication,  the fingerprint of the message (See \\\"What is a fingerprint, like  MD5?\\\") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can  use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message  must have come from the sender.   RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who  invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in  pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.  6)  What is DES?   DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.   RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter,  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.   DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large  corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future  RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using  multiple encryption with DES.  7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate?   PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of  encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.   RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys?   For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important  that this information be accurate; if a \\\"bad guy\\\" convinces her that  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.   RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server,  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution.  None of them provide perfect security.  9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?   RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various  characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in  your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the  same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the  same length, etc.  10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?   MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc.  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash,  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus,  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key,  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.   MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.   MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in  RFC 1321.  11)  What is PGP?   PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently.  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.   Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM:   - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without    a direct network connection.   - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of    working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible    with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with    PGP 2.0.)   - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security    Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.    PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,    PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims    that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in    the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original    author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:     #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,     #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is    #contraband.     - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside    the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites    in Europe and other places.   Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues.   Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export  restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it  shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents  differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably  seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in  misc.legal.computing.  (See:  \\\"DISCLAIMER\\\")  12)  What about RPEM?   RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM,  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in  an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark  Riordan, the same author as RIPEM.   Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many  (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent  was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested  in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA.  This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not  challenged for pragmatic reasons.   RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  13)  What is MIME?   MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup  comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely  clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type  application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I  hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on  the matter.  14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...\",\"Has anyone had experience porting imake to DOS using a Microsoft, Watcom, or any
