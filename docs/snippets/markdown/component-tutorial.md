???+ info "This page addresses a **single component** of `hover`"
    We are using code snippets to pick out parts of the annotation interface, so that the documentation can explain what they do.

    -   Please be aware that this is NOT how one would typically use `hover`.
    -   Typical usage deals with [recipes](../../tutorial/t1-active-learning) where the individual parts have been tied together.
