### Shoutouts

-   Thanks to [`Bokeh`](https://bokeh.org) because `hover` would not exist without linked plots and callbacks, or be nearly as good without embeddable server apps.
-   Thanks to [Philip Vollet](https://de.linkedin.com/in/philipvollet) for sharing `hover` with the community even when it was really green.

### Contributing

-   All feedbacks are welcome, **especially what you find lacking and want it fixed!**
-   `./requirements-dev.txt` lists required packages for development.
-   Pull requests are advised to use a superset of the pre-commit hooks listed in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/phurwicz/hover/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml).
