    To render `bokeh` plots in Jupyter, you need:
    ```shell
    pip install jupyter_bokeh
    ```

    If you are using JupyterLab older than 3.0, use this instead ([reference](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-bokeh/)):
    ```shell
    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
    jupyter labextension install @bokeh/jupyter_bokeh
    ```
